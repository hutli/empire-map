While there are of course many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> in Upwold, the quick-growing silver birch woods on the eastern borders are the source of a great deal of income.

The birch bark is used in the tanning industry, to cure the hides of the cattle that graze on the river pastures. </p><p>Upwold has always felt a certain rivalry with Mitwold to the west. There is no argument that the farms of Upwold tend not to be as fertile as those of their neighbours; the soil tends to be quite acidic. In part, this has lead to a more diverse economy - while the farm is the centre of Marcher life here as elsewhere, there are many who make their living from trees rather than crops, which occasionally attracts comment from the more agriculturally minded Mitwolders. </p><p>The people who live up here have closer links to the Navarr than many in the Marches, and more need for Beaters than most.

The first settlers arrived here shortly after the Highborn arrived on the shores of the Bay of Catazar, but the territory was not completely conquered for several decades. The Highborn focused primarily on civilizing <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis\" title=\"Necropolis\">Pharos</a>, and then securing the frontier in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion\" title=\"Bastion\">Bastion</a>. Casinea was heavily forested, a wilderness dominated by savage orcs who fought viciously against human settlers. Eventually tiring of raids from the north-west the patricians turned their attention to the rich woodlands and mobilized their armies to deal with the barbarians as they had dealt with those in Pharos and Bastion, They were only partially successful. Even after the eastern regions were conquered, bands of scattered orcs remained to harass settlers - indeed there are reports of orc raiders attacking into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Casfall\">Casfall</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrwatch\">Syrwatch</a> as late as 150YE.</p><p>After the armies came the settlers. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Casfall\">Casfall</a> (originally called <i>Newland</i>) was quickly dominated by farms and timberyards. Within a generation, construction began on the fortification in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Mareholm\">Mareholm</a> that would protect against the orc presence in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a>. While clearing forest and finding stone and metal in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrwatch\">Syrwatch</a> (or <i>Northwood</i> as it was then), scouts discovered the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#The_Pool_of_Syrene\" title=\"Casinea\">Pool of Syrene</a>, and the powerful Tutamen patrician family claimed the region. Their claim was contested by the Kehment family, and political wrangling eventually boiled over into armed aggression. Some historians point to this short-lived conflict as the first real sign of the corruption beginning to take root in the patrician families. The Tutamen were ultimately victorious, leaving the Kehment broken and bitter - they would eventually quit Highguard altogether for the nascent city of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos\" title=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</a> to the west. The Tutamen moved their entire household to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrene.27s_Wisdom\">Syrene's Wisdom</a>, and renamed the entire region after their patrician. Their presence the pace of colonization - in the east at least. While the woods were slowly cleared from Syrwatch, Mareholm, and Newland, the western woods remained wild and completely unsettled until the time of the Revelation.</p><p>When the Virtuous first began to abandon the heartlands of Highguard, a significant majority built their chapters on the frontier. For most this meant Bastion, but several chapters were established in western Mareholm and Newland. A handful of the most <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambition\" title=\"Ambition\">Ambitious</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Courage\" title=\"Courage\">Courageous</a>, however, sought the freedom to expand into the western woods. Several wanted isolation not only from the corrupt patricians, but even from other chapters - the solitude necessary to explore their relationship with the virtues without distractions. These rugged chapters carved out demesnes from the woods, driving the remaining orcs west and north as they did so. Even today, the chapters of western Casinea have a reputation for being insular and standoffish.</p><p>By the time of the Highborn civil war, then, Casinea was split roughly in two. The eastern regions - Syrwatch, Casfall/Newland, and Mareholm - were settled and prosperous, dominated by the patrician families, and protected by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#The_Silent_Sentinel\">Silent Sentinel</a>.

Over time, both towns grew on each bank and the river formed a natural boundary between them.

Along with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos\" title=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</a>, they quietly seceded from Highguard during that nations' civil war, uniting with their cousins to the south to resist all attempts to bring them back under the Highborn banner.</p><p>The western part of the city is called Tassato Mestra, and the eastern is Tassato Regario. The people on either side of the river are historically rivals, and that historical rivalry occasionally boils up into open conflict. The two cities were unified under the control of Anabela di Regario, a merchant prince who ruled over a century before the creation of the Empire. Anabela was forced to contend with the constant rivalry between the two cities- open battles in the streets between bravos were causing widespread lawlessness and in the end the prince declared a ban on the open carrying of weapons. The ban had the desired effect, damping down the bloodshed although and the rivalry was slowly transformed to verbal banter between the two sides. The ban endured until Tassato joined the Empire and in that time the people became famous for their wordplay, launching quips and insults at each other like arrows.</p><p>Citizens of Tassato generally refer to Regario and Mestra as separate places, while everyone else refers to them as wards or parts of the same city.Today Tassato enjoys an unrivalled reputation as a city where the spoken word is an art-form. Tassatans take a delight in layered meanings, subtexts and unspoken communication. The city has provided several senators famous for their brilliant oratory and representatives from the city are usually regarded as the finest diplomats in the Empire. Of all the people of the League, Tassatans are most likely to view life as a game and they are notorious for their love of intrigue, not just for the sake of advancement but for the sheer pleasure to be had thereby. They regard cunning diplomacy more highly than armed conflict, not because they are peace-loving, but instead because they regard words as a more effective tool than weapons in destroying their enemies - better to set enemies against enemies than to face them yourself. Manipulation is high art here - no surprise that some of the finest <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mountebanks\" title=\"Mountebanks\" class=\"mw-redirect\">mountebanks</a> hail from Tassato.</p><p>Tassato chooses a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> each Autumn equinox, and as might be imagined the election is often bitterly contested. Traditionally, being senator for Tassato is regarded as one of the worst seats in the Imperial Senate. If the senator is from the city itself, then they often encounter resistance and hostility from the folk from the other side of the river. If they are not from the city proper - if they refuse to pick a side - they are generally treated as interlopers and encounter harassment from citizens from both sides of the river. A few wealthy guilds that live outside the city proper maintain a discreet distance from the intrigues of their more urban cousins - the votes of these guilds are much sought after by candidates regardless of where they live.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Bold_Tassatan.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Bold Tassatan.png\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png/500px-Bold_Tassatan.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">Tassato is home to bold bravos, master merchants, divine dramaturges and princes of the League.</div></div>"}, "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-13.84, -27.84], [-4.22, -28.65], [5.67, -34.33], [1.78, -40.51], [-6.64, -42.88], [-8.33, -48.99], [-23.23, -50.29], [-27.69, -48.34], [-29.44, -45.03], [-23.91, -41.61], [-22.98, -36.32], [-16.66, -34.74]]]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"url": "https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos", "nation": "The League", "name": "Sarvos", "description": "<p>Sarvos refers both to a territory, and the city that sits at the heart of that territory. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League_history#Origins_of_the_League\" title=\"The League history\">Founded</a> long ago by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard\" title=\"Highguard\">Highborn</a> colonists, it seceded from that nation during the civil war and has remained independent ever since. </p><p>The city itself is constructed on <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos#Cigno\">an island</a> just off the coast, like a beacon of light in the water.

The four rivers are central characters in the art and folklore of the city. All the classic literature and theatre includes them in one form or another, whether as central characters or \u201cclowns\u201d during the interludes.

Anyone with a tattoo on their body was given a few minutes to collect their belongings before being forced from the city into the frozen snows beyond the walls.
