<div class="ic"><div class="ic-inner quote"><p>?Life is short ? let it never be dull!?</p></div></div>
<p>The Freeborn of the Brass Coast are travellers, traders, lovers and poets. They are exuberant and flamboyant; when they laugh their humour is infectious and without spite, when they love they do so with a passion that is without guile and when they?re angry, their wrath is like a summer storm ? terrible to behold but swift in passing. To be Freeborn is to be driven by a hunger for life, to see the world, to taste every delicacy, sample every wine and tell every tale. Success is measured in wealth, family and influence, not out of greed, but for the joy success brings.
</p><p>The Freeborn prize individual freedom and responsibility. Although they are capable of serving a cause they have little respect for authority. Pompous or self-important individuals, especially those who think that titles and positions have made them important, are ridiculed on the Coast. Respect is earned, it cannot be bought or appointed.
</p><p>While others see them as outspoken and brazen, their <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">honesty</a> is without arrogance, for to aggrandise the self is vulgar, while to praise the deeds of another is an art. Their tales are bawdy enough for a common tavern and grand enough for a lordly court alike and can fill a room with laughter, tears or gasps of horror.
</p><p>Their wagons and ships cross the world bringing exotic goods that command the finest prices. They are renowned for their <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Corsair" title="Corsair">corsairs</a>, who operate out of the Bay of Catazar. These daring privateers risk everything ensuring that the Empire's enemies are unable to threaten her shores and earning a fortune in gold in the process. It is a dangerous life but one that perfectly suits the Freeborn passion for high adventure.

<ul><li> <b>They are notoriously candid.</b> Brazen in person, and disarmingly frank in negotiation, they are never afraid to speak their mind when they want to.</li>
<li> <b>All things <i>can</i> have a price.</b> The Freeborn believe the fairest way to reckon the worth of something is to put a price on it.</li>
<li> <b>They prize freedom and responsibility and disdain arrogance.</b> The Freeborn philosophy is that society is best served when every individual is responsible for themselves and to themselves.</li>
<li> <b>They crave adventure and excitement.</b> None more so than their corsairs who are the terror of the high seas.</li>
<li> <b>They like agreements to be explicit.</b> The Freeborn like everybody to know exactly what has been agreed to.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_the_Freeborn_are_not">What the Freeborn are not</span></h2>
<ul><li> <b>Desert dwellers.</b> Grassy plains, rocky mountains and shipboard on the ocean are where the Freeborn live.</li>
<li> <b>Dodgy camel sellers or slave traders.</b> Freeborn traders are upfront and scrupulously honest - the very opposite of the stereotype of the obsequious, wheedling trader.</li>
<li> <b>Matriarchal or patriarchal.</b> The Freeborn are matrilineal, they take their mother?s family name, but other than this their society is completely gender blind. There are no harems or seraglios in the Empire.</li></ul>

<p>The people of the Brass Coast are divided into three great tribes descended from the families of the three founders, named the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Riqueza,_Erigo,_and_Guerra#Erigo" title="Riqueza, Erigo, and Guerra" class="mw-redirect">Erigo</a>, the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Riqueza,_Erigo,_and_Guerra#Riqueza" title="Riqueza, Erigo, and Guerra" class="mw-redirect">Riqueza</a> and the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Riqueza,_Erigo,_and_Guerra#Guerra" title="Riqueza, Erigo, and Guerra" class="mw-redirect">Guerra</a>. Every Freeborn traces their line through their mother's family to one of the founders, and this creates their tribal identity. Each tribe is composed of a great number of extended <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Family" title="Family">families</a>. The smallest families have only a few dozen members, the largest can have hundreds or thousands of people sharing a family name and a common purpose.
</p><p>The archetypal Freeborn is forthright, <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">honest</a> about their actions, and unashamed of their motives. The Freeborn do not feel they owe the world anything, but neither do they feel the world owes them. They can be charitable, but only when they choose; they can be selfish, but never with their family. They are direct, notoriously frank and gloriously unabashed.
</p><p>The Freeborn give freely to family and expect the same in return. But with everyone else they would rather define a debt and know what is owed and to whom, instead of being left with an undefined obligation. They detest unspecified favours and obligations, even between friends or lovers, because there is no certainty to what is owed. An honest interaction is one where people know what they are offering, what they are getting and what it will cost them.
</p>
<div class="captioned-image captioned-image-right"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:FreebornPride.jpg" class="image"><img alt="FreebornPride.jpg" src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f6/FreebornPride.jpg/600px-FreebornPride.jpg" width="600" height="338" srcset="/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f6/FreebornPride.jpg/900px-FreebornPride.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f6/FreebornPride.jpg/1200px-FreebornPride.jpg 2x" /></a><div class="caption">They are exuberant as their clothes are bright.</div></div>
<p>To the Freeborn, all things can have a price. Most Freeborn do not earn their living as a merchant, but almost all seek out opportunities to turn a profit. Even in social situations, they are comfortable seeing their interactions with others in monetary terms. Freeborn hosts are not insulted by a guests' offer to pay for a meal, nor by a request to purchase an ancient family heirloom. They are no greedier than other people -- there are plenty of things they wouldn't contemplate selling -- but they won't be angry at you for asking, provided you accept their refusal.
</p><p>The Freeborn are notoriously candid. Transactions that in other nations would be conducted discreetly in private are carried out openly on the Brass Coast without shame. They are perfectly comfortable with someone paying to influence a political decision, but they expect those making the decision to be unabashed of their actions. The Freeborn are fully aware that other nations do not share their values. They don't expect frankness from other nations but they don't allow others to impose their values on them.
</p><p>The Freeborn are passionate people who love dancing, story-telling and performance. The best dances are energetic and exuberant, and those who aren?t dancing are encouraged to join in by making music to cheer the dancers on. The best stories are bold, often bawdy and are delivered as a performance designed to involve and energise the audience. It is considered rude to boast; telling the tales of your own deeds is vulgar and if it must be done, events should always be described as if they happened to a friend. To tell the tale of another?s deeds does them great honour. The Freeborn love to include the earthy parts of a story, but are always clear when they are embellishing the tale, for instance, "I don't know what happened next, but I like to imagine it was like this..." The art of a Freeborn story-teller is to make even the most mundane tale become engaging or hilarious by the delivery. They particularly like to include their audience, getting them to act out the parts described or cheer and sing along at appropriate moments.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Names">Names</span></h2>
<p>Freeborn names are primarily Spanish/Mexican in flavour, with Moorish influence.
</p><p>Freeborn typically have three names. The first is their given name as decided by their parents and can be as creative or as bland as their imagination. The second is their family name and the last name is that of the tribe - one of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Riqueza,_Erigo,_and_Guerra#Erigo" title="Riqueza, Erigo, and Guerra" class="mw-redirect">Erigo</a>, the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Riqueza,_Erigo,_and_Guerra#Riqueza" title="Riqueza, Erigo, and Guerra" class="mw-redirect">Riqueza</a> or the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Riqueza,_Erigo,_and_Guerra#Guerra" title="Riqueza, Erigo, and Guerra" class="mw-redirect">Guerra</a>. 
</p><p>Freeborn names follow the pattern ?firstname? <i>i</i> ?family? <i>i</i> ?tribe?. <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hakima" title="Hakima">Hakima</a> and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_military_concerns#Kohan" title="The Brass Coast military concerns">kohan</a> often drop the family name and use just their tribal name. 
</p><p>The tribe name of a Brass Coast character is usually that of his or her mother but there are some customs related to <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Matrilineality#Marriage" title="Matrilineality">marriage</a> that may lead a man (but never a woman) to have a different tribal name to the one he was born with.
</p><p>A character who was adopted into the Brass Coast has no tribal name. Only a character whose mother possessed a tribe name can legitimately identify themselves as part of that tribe. While such a character can become kohan or hakima, they generally choose to keep their family name as discarding it is seen as reducing their connection to the Brass Coast.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Family">Family</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Family" title="Family">Family</a> is important to the Freeborn. They live in extended family groups covering several generations with a strong emphasis on helping and supporting each other. Occasionally Freeborn will extend the privilege of family membership to valued friends, long-term employees or waifs and strays - these adoptees are whole-heartedly welcomed and are treated no different from blood relations. To the Freeborn, betraying your family is unforgivable.
</p><p>The responsibility that the Freeborn feel for family members does not extend to others. The Freeborn make a point of disclaiming any responsibility for the wellbeing of others. They do not regard themselves as obliged to help the poor or the sick, the dispossessed or the homeless. They may be as charitable as they please, but they refuse to accept that it is their responsibility to care for others.
</p>
<div class="captioned-image captioned-image-right"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:BrassLounge.jpg" class="image"><img alt="BrassLounge.jpg" src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/2/2c/BrassLounge.jpg/350px-BrassLounge.jpg" width="350" height="276" srcset="/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/2/2c/BrassLounge.jpg/525px-BrassLounge.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/2/2c/BrassLounge.jpg 2x" /></a><div class="caption"></div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hospitality">Hospitality</span></h2>
<p>On the Coast, food and drink are only offered freely to family. Since most Freeborn habitually avoid favours and social debts but all Freeborn enjoy hospitality, both giving and receiving, the custom is always to offer to pay before receiving refreshments. A Freeborn approaching a tent of revelry might ask the price for a seat at the table. A token price of a ring or two indicates that they are very welcome to join, a price in crowns indicates that the meeting is private and the Freeborn should look elsewhere, but an exorbitant price in thrones is a deliberate insult.
</p><p>Despite the ritualised nature of the exchange, actual payment is required. To the Freeborn mind, it is the payment that ensures that no further obligation exists on the part of either party. For close friends or clearly impoverished a Freeborn might offer a fine meal for help with the dishes or even an afternoon's work. It is easy to be itinerant in Freeborn society, so long as you don't mind working for your supper.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Syrah">Syrah</span></h2>
<p>Syrah is the ritualised drink of the Freeborn, habitually offered to guests, business associates and drunk during family affairs. Each family carefully guards their own recipe for syrah, and there is a common belief that to give away its secret is to give some of your good luck to another. Syrah can be almost anything, a brew of coffee or tea sweetened with honey or sugar, a fruit juice or a fine wine, but should be pleasant and appealing. It is not strongly alcoholic since it is intended to be drunk as a family and when business is being discussed. Offering syrah before the opening of trade negotiations is considered not only polite but beneficial to the coming talks.

<div class="captioned-image captioned-image-left"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:FreebornScrivener.jpg" class="image"><img alt="FreebornScrivener.jpg" src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/6/6b/FreebornScrivener.jpg/350px-FreebornScrivener.jpg" width="350" height="224" srcset="/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/6/6b/FreebornScrivener.jpg/525px-FreebornScrivener.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/6/6b/FreebornScrivener.jpg/700px-FreebornScrivener.jpg 2x" /></a><div class="caption">Freeborn scriveners are often cambions.</div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Contracts">Contracts</span></h2>
<p>Written contracts are exceptionally important in Freeborn culture. The best contracts are short and succinct but clearly identify the obligations of both parties. To the Freeborn mind, making an agreement commits the integrity of their soul to the deal. If they contract to do something their reputation is at stake if they cannot carry out the letter of the contract. For this reason, almost all enduring contracts include fiscal clauses for default. This is not meant as a lack of commitment, but simply to avoid being a hostage to fortune should circumstances change and make it impossible for the parties to complete the deal. The Freeborn see no shame in going back on contracts provided the default bonds are paid - since such defaults are, of course, a part of the letter of the contract.
</p><p>A scrivener is often employed to help make sure that a contract is clear and that both sides understand their obligations. These professionals also serve as witnesses who can help confirm the validity of a contract. Many scriveners are <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Cambion" title="Cambion">cambions</a>, and there is a superstition that the blood of a cambion (usually a thumbprint) upon a document of trade will bring good fortune to the signatories - or dire circumstance to one who breaks the contract.
</p><p>Contracts are also a common <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_hearth_magic" title="The Brass Coast hearth magic">hearth magic</a> on the Brass Coast.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Art">Art</span></h2>
<p>Calligraphy is highly valued along the Brass Coast. They value books but treasure those that are beautifully illuminated. To the Freeborn, every aspect of writing is an important artistic statement. The language used should be articulate and possess a lyrical quality; the letters and words should be written with bold ink strokes on beautiful paper or parchment that is then decorated and illuminated. Given their emphasis on deals, it is no surprise that the Freeborn prefer their contracts to be beautifully inked. They often display particularly fine examples on the walls of their homes, especially ones that have great sentimental or fiscal value.
</p><p>Music and dance form the heart of nearly any Freeborn celebration. Passion and enthusiasm are valued over technical precision, and it is common for any musical performance to include well-known songs with which the entire audience can join in.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Marriages_and_relationships">Marriages and relationships</span></h2>
<p>Freeborn society does not favour men or women but tribal and familial lines are always matrilineal. Because of this while men may marry into a Freeborn family and tribe, women can not. If a Freeborn woman marries then her spouse joins her tribal family. On the rare occasion when two Freeborn women from different tribes marry, they live together but formally remain members of different tribes.
</p><p>Marriage outside the tribe is relatively rare. Much more common is for Freeborn men and women to form temporary attachments. These attachments are romantic or physical in nature, but with no assumption that they will last for life. In fact, with some pairings there is no assumption that they will last more than a night.
</p><p>All marriages ? and indeed most extended attachments ? are formalised with a contract in which each participant lays down the parameters of the relationship. A marriage or relationship contract commonly covers matters such as the duration of the relationship, the rights and responsibilities of the participants, the expectation of fidelity and the options for marriage and relationship contracts with others, the division of shared wealth both during and after the relationship ends, and at least one clause covering how the relationship may be ended prematurely by either party. This rather cold-blooded practicality around matters of the heart is just another manifestation of the Freeborn's fiscal approach to life. These contracts ensure that both parties know the value the other places on the attachment. Not all attachments require a contract, but if a relationship is going to last for more than a few weeks, it is considered a sensible precaution against misunderstandings.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Funerals">Funerals</span></h2>
<p>Freeborn dead are wrapped in spice-infused wraps of black cloth and then burned. The resulting ashes are scattered on the sea, or on the winds of the plain, depending on the family's wishes.
</p><p>A funeral is rarely a sombre affair. The Freeborn take joy in a life well-lived and they consider it an insult to mourn its passing. Attendees wear brightly coloured robes and focus on celebrating the life of the deceased. It is normal for the will to be read by a sutannir at the height of the party. The will is the last chance to share a joke with loved ones and it is traditional for it to be as humorous as possible, akin to a best man's speech at a wedding. On the rare occasion when grief is appropriate, such as with the death of a child, the grieving is much shorter but just as open and intense.
</p><p>An old tradition says that those lost at sea take new form as dolphins who will guide and guard lost ships. While no-one really believes it these days, it is a stock element in many stories involving sea travel. 
</p><p>A personification of death sometimes appears in Freeborn stories, and is especially popular in plays and as a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Doctor#Death" title="The Doctor">dramaturgic archetype</a>. As a character, Death is usually mocked as a figure of fun, a bumbling idiot and a clown who can easily be outwitted through courage and cunning. The counterpart of death is <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Witch#Fortune" title="The Witch">Fortune</a>, who personifies ideas of luck and chance as well as fate or destiny. These literary tropes have a deeper philosophical context; such stories often explore the idea that death may come suddenly and without warning, as a result of happenstance or bad luck. This is especially important to a people as dedicated to getting as much out of life as the Freeborn are.

<p>The Freeborn <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Egregores" title="Egregores">egregore</a> is a changable spirit that carries three names. As Dust, Glass, and Flame the egregore embodies uniquely Freeborn beliefs about the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_religious_beliefs" title="The Brass Coast religious beliefs">nature of the soul</a>. An individual host may favour one of the three aspects or switch between them depending on their mood, the desires of the spirit, and the needs of the nation. Regardless of the name it answers to, the spirit is fond of dancing and storytelling, and the enjoyment they take in the pleasures of life serve as an inspiration to many Freeborn. They are unfailingly <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">honest</a> in their words and dealings, and despite the apparently easy-going nature of the spirit the egregore is a fierce champion of the Freeborn people.  
</p><p>When in the aspect of <i>Dust</i>, the egregore dresses comfortably and luxuriantly and talks about the importance of family and plain honest speaking. As <i>Glass</i>, the egregore is a quiet philosopher, dressing practically, and likes to talk about the soul and what it means to be Freeborn. Glass also occasionally appears dressed in the manner of a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_military_concerns" title="The Brass Coast military concerns">kohan</a>. Finally, when in the guise of <i>Flame</i>, the egregore prefers the exuberant styling of a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_religious_beliefs" title="The Brass Coast religious beliefs">sutannir</a>, encouraging parties and celebrations, and inspiring those going to war. Martial concerns are of particular interest to Flame. The three aspects can often be identified by the colour of their tagelmust: Dust favours sandy yellows, Flame favours reds, and Glass favours blues and greens.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Egregore_Hosts">Egregore Hosts</span></h3>
<p>As per tradition, the hosts of Freeborn egregore put aside their family name, taking the nation as family. There are three hosts who regularly attend summits at Anvil, although it is uncommon for all three to be present at the same time.<br />
<b>Marcela i Erigo</b><br />
Marcela up among the traders and corsairs who berthed their ships in <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga" title="Madruga">Madruga</a> and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feroz" title="Feroz">Feroz</a>, dealing with travelers from within and without the Empire. She speaks very little of her life before becoming the egregore preferring instead to focus on listening to the stories of other people. What is known is that she has an extensive family, including a younger brother, and many aunts and uncles; that she lived for a time as a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Corsair" title="Corsair">corsair</a> or sailor; that is no stranger to fighting; and that she has visited or dealt with <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sumaah_Republic" title="Sumaah Republic">Suumah</a> sufficiently to speak the language for trade purposes. She also suffers from a persistent wound, received in her youth,  that occasionally flares up and incapacitates her for days on end.<br />
<b>Jaime i Guerra</b><br />
Jaime i Guerra's family was mostly killed during the barbarian attack on <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura" title="Segura">Segura</a>. He fled with his younger brother to safety in <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga" title="Madruga">Madruga</a> but never really settled down: he developed a fascination with the sea that led to him being a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Corsair" title="Corsair">corsair</a>, forever traveling over the oceans. Although at times he takes on all three of the faces of the egregore, it is the fiery emotions of <i>Flame</i> that burn brightest in him: he loves laughing, music, partying, and fighting. As he has forged links to more members of the nation through his roles as egregore, he is also starting to become Dust more often.<br />
<b>Sol i Riqueza</b><br />
Sol i Riqueza is one of the most recent hosts of the egregore spirit. A young <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hakima" title="Hakima">hakima</a> who has spent two decades years growing up between the northern mountains of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman" title="Kahraman">Kahraman</a> and the plains of Rojota, developing a love for this land and its fractious families. He has yet to settle truly within each of the faces of the spirit, still learning the moods that fit him best but he has shown clear preferences for embodying the aspects attuned to those Freeborn that are without families, both hakima and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_military_concerns#Kohan" title="The Brass Coast military concerns">kohan</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast" title="The Brass Coast">Freeborn</a> look is one of bright colours, silks, jewels, and sumptuousness. They admire ornate or bejewelled items. To the Freeborn, a brilliant craftsman is one who can make something elegant as well as sturdy. Their weapons and armour are often engraved or adorned, but they are not fatuous and do not compromise utility for the sake of appearance. Jewellery is very common with the best pieces, like necklaces, crowns or tiaras, designed to frame the wearer's hands or face.
</p><p>The image of the flame is central to the Freeborn culture; they believe it represents their spirit: wild, powerful and unchained.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feel">Feel</span></h3>
<p>Free, flowing, headstrong, sumptuous, practical, exuberant, hedonistic, colourful, rich, joyful. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Influences">Influences</span></h3>
<p>The traditional looks of Moorish Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Colours">Colours</span></h3>
<p>The Freeborn value bright, vibrant colours, especially the colours of flames: strong bright yellows, brilliant oranges and every conceivable shade of red as well as gold and silver. Peacock blue, Magenta and Turquoise often appear for contrast. Expensive clothing is made in brightly coloured layers to convey the impression of the fire within. 
</p>
<div class="captioned-image captioned-image-none"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Brass_coast_colours.png" class="image"><img alt="Brass coast colours.png" src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/5/5a/Brass_coast_colours.png" width="599" height="211" /></a><div class="caption"></div></div>
<p>Black is considered severe and used for shrouds to wrap the dead. White is the colour of the poor, those too impoverished to afford exotic dyes.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Materials">Materials</span></h3>
<p>Lightweight fabrics such as voiles and chiffons, either silk or synthetic. Also silks, brocades and other rich fabrics. Leather is considered unappealing for most clothing, it is a heavy material mainly reserved for boots and armour. Gold is prized over silver when available. When working in colder climes, such as at sea, a warmer layer of fleece or wool is worn as a base layer.
Gold, bronze and brass are much-prized, as are carved wooden objects (which are often imported, given the lack of wood on the Coast).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Clothing">Clothing</span></h2>
<p>Veils, scarves, head-wraps, pantaloons, loose shirts and kaftans, are all part of Freeborn garb. Clothing is usually worn loose with layers of draped material slashed through to show a wealth of colour, and secured with sashes rather than belts. Outfits will often be decorated with shiny jewellery, bells, coins showing wealth in the glint of metal in the sun and the sound of metal as the wearer moves. Scabbards or pouches tend to hang at the waist by a silk cord that goes over the shoulder

Javelins and bows are common but the Catazarri crossbow is also used. Many are lightly armoured, but the boldest show off their success with ornately gilded plate. They may dress more simply than other Freeborn in trousers and tunic, but their flair for wealth tends to show through with jewellery worn at wrist and neck.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kohan">Kohan</span></h3>
<p>Whilst some may feel that with their separated identity and the history of being disowned from their families <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_military_concerns" title="The Brass Coast military concerns">Kohan</a> would be more muted in their colours and overall costume - the opposite is in fact true.
With their unique attitude to each day being lived like their last as tomorrow they may die, the Kohan have more of an affinity for going above and beyond when it comes to appearance, favouring more extravagant looks to strike fear into their enemies, so much so that even in the Brass Coast a member of the Kohan should be able to be told apart from others by the exuberance of their clothes.
On top of this, they are known for displaying grotesque warpaint in battle, adding a little more distinction to their overall look.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Icons_and_Artistry">Icons and Artistry</span></h2>
<p>Stylised flames are often found on banners and flags and Freeborn art often includes a fire or flame in the image.
The Freeborn love of the ornate extends to their writing as well; Freeborn prize artful calligraphy and ornate seals. A beautifully presented children?s book is treasured more than a dry treatise on magic or history, no matter how useful the latter might be. Given that many families keep their most lucrative or successful contracts as trophies of their economic acumen, a contract may be a literal work of art, presented with the same pride that members of another nation might present a coat of arms or family tree.

<p>Jewellery is commonly used either as part of the clothes themselves or to frame the face or hands to draw attention to them. Veils are fashionable for men and women who wish to appear mysterious and alluring. Those who go tattooed tend to favour intricate henna-style designs.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Less_Appropriate">Less Appropriate</span></h2>
<p>In defining the ideal look and feel for the Brass Coast we have chosen not to include some images. Some items were omitted so that the overall range of images avoids becoming too broad - we want each nation to look distinctive. Sometimes items were left out because the real world significance of them is so strong that it would impact the game, we want to avoid players confusing these nations with real world cultures. And some items are not part of the ideal because they come from a different historical period or are more modern in feel. It is common to see costume inspired by a range of historical periods but we wanted to be clear on what the ideal was. 
</p><p>We've listed some of the items we chose not to include in the look and feel below along with a short explanation of why they are not perfect for the Brass Coast. It is okay to use these items as part of your kit, creating a costume is always a compromise as time and money are limited. What we want to do is be clear on the suggestions we are making, so that players who are looking to create new kit or add to their existing kit can be confident about what will look great for the nation.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh" rel="nofollow" class="external text">shemagh or keffiyeh<i class="icon-share-alt"></i></a>, the traditional headscarf that is white or patterned is more typical of the Middle East and more importantly it often looks very modern.

<p>Although there are no particular modesty taboos, dancers tend to be far more interested in showing off how they can make fabrics flare and move than displaying their own flesh. Wild passionate dancing is a common Freeborn pursuit for men and women, but the perfect Freeborn costume features long flowing colourful garments. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eO_g0Rrx_w" rel="nofollow" class="external text">Roxanne's dance<i class="icon-share-alt"></i></a> from the movie Alexander is a great inspiration for Freeborn dancing and costume.

<p>Before the formation of the Empire, <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Riqueza,_Erigo,_and_Guerra" title="Riqueza, Erigo, and Guerra" class="mw-redirect">three sisters</a> lived in <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis" title="Necropolis">Pharos</a>. Members of the patrician families of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard" title="Highguard">Highguard</a>, each was a powerful magician in her own right. Dissatisfied with life in the city, and sickened by the chaos of the time of turmoil, they took their extended families - their extensive households - and left. They travelled to a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#Free_Landing" title="Madruga">new home</a> on the opposite side of the Bay of Catazar, said to have been revealed to them by the divinatory magics of the three sisters. Freeborn storytellers still recount the epic tale of the exodus of the three tribes.
</p><p>By the time the Empress began her crusade to unite humanity beneath her banner, the Freeborn were much as they are today ? a disparate people of sprawling, extended families spread over three tribes, with each tribe tracing an unbroken matrilineal line back to one of the founders. While each family and each tribe treasured their individual freedoms, they were bound together into a loose nation by a shared heritage and by carefully negotiated contracts and treaties.
</p><p>Initially, the tribes were suspicious of the Empress and hostile to the interests of the powerful Highborn priests who backed her. After a long negotiation between the Empress and prominent tribal leaders, they agreed to join the nascent Empire. The Freeborn negotiators were instrumental in slavery being outlawed and it was at their insistence that each nation would set the means to select their own senators. Their most significant contribution was the creation of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Nationality#Egregore" title="Nationality">egregores</a>, ensuring that every nation was able to preserve its traditions. They were unable to convince the priests of Highguard to acknowledge the central role of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">honesty</a> in a virtuous life, but they are enormously proud that their influence ensured that their ideas of individual freedom and responsibility became a central part of the Empire's identity. 
</p><p>Since that day, the Freeborn have been able to present themselves as traders backed by the full weight of the Empire. It is something they use, sometimes shamelessly, to their advantage when dealing with foreign powers. The stability provided by the Empire has allowed the Freeborn to sail far beyond their territories, bringing in great wealth to all the nations.
</p><p>There has only ever been one Freeborn Emperor, <b><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Ahraz" title="Emperor Ahraz">Ahraz i Contero i Guerra</a></b>, who freed the orc slaves and was instrumental in bringing them into the Empire. The Freeborn believe that it is in the Senate that true power lies and that the best Emperors have accepted this and served as figureheads and administrators rather than policy makers. Popular prejudice paints the Freeborn as poor politicians ? a slur that several of them embrace. Their blunt frankness combined with a tendency to want to get to the point of any argument does not endear them to their political opponents, but they make up for this directness with a tendency to produce powerful and impassioned orators.

<p>The Freeborn are traditionally cautious when it comes to the idea of authority and control. They value loyalty and even discipline, but they are an informal people who have little regard for titles and status and even less for those who think such positions make them more important than their fellows.
</p><p>By tradition, each Freeborn family is represented by a dhomiro. Their role is to represent their family's interests to those who seek to deal with the family as a whole. Choosing a dhomiro is not a political decision, most families simply select the most suitable individual. They are usually chosen on account of their ability to organise or communicate, and they have great influence but little formal power. Any dhomiro that put on airs or graces would be ridiculed and dhomiro that are not effective in furthering their family's interests are quickly replaced.
</p><p>The reality of this loose-weave community is that towns, villages, and trade wagons are effectively governed by the wealthiest, most influential family who dwells there. This can lead to fluid but infrequent shifts of power as familial fortunes wax and wane. When more formal agreements are needed, the dhomiro of each family involved will negotiate a formal contract.
</p><p>Freeborn society is not so much controlled as ?nudged in a beneficial direction? by the families with the most power and influence. There is little leadership beyond the dhomiro. There is a presumption of cooperation between different families that are part of the same tribe, but this presumption only makes the inevitable rivalries more fierce. When this rivalry threatens to get out of hand, it often falls to the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hakima" title="Hakima">hakima</a> ? the magical custodians of the Freeborn tribal legacy ? to step in and try to mediate some sort of peaceful conclusion. While the hakima have no formal authority over the dhomiro, their advice and magical support can help turn a strong family into a truly great family. The hakima stand outside the traditional Freeborn family structure, placing the nation above all other loyalties; their official role is to help ensure Freeborn prosperity and security. This neutrality makes them an essential part of the political structure and most are highly respected.
</p><p>To outsiders, it is a chaotic and unstructured form of governance, but to the Freeborn it is as natural as breathing. When an outsider finds themselves frustrated trying to work out who is in charge, the traditional Freeborn response is ?the wind?. A less metaphorical response might be to ask ?why does someone always have to be in charge?? When a decision needs making that affects a number of families, the hakima and the families gather to ?discuss? the issue. To outsiders this is a wild affair of drink and revelry, but the informal atmosphere of the gathering in no way undermines the severity of the discussions. The exchange of coin, scripts of trade and goods eventually leads to a common opinion and subsequent decision, usually formalised through a contract.

<p>Despite this, Imperial rule requires that the Freeborn select <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator" title="Senator">senators</a>. The Freeborn solution is simple; wealth and influence dictate many things in Freeborn life and they see no reason why senatorial seats should be any different. As a result, when a senatorial seat becomes vacant, the Brass Coast hold an open auction at which any dhomiro can participate. Whoever presents the highest purse wins the right to appoint the senator. Only someone who is recognized as a dhomiro may bid in the auction. Dhomiro is not an <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_title" title="Imperial title">Imperial title</a> so there is no concept of a legal <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Proxy" title="Proxy">proxy</a> being appointed, but this does not often become an issue - it is rarely the business of another family how a dhomiro is chosen, or how they serve their people. The winning family may choose any Freeborn citizen to take the title, including a dhomiro or a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hakima" title="Hakima">hakima</a>.
</p><p>Those who are not successful in claiming a seat reclaim their purse. The money paid by the winner is given into the care of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Brass_Coast_Egregore" title="Brass Coast Egregore">egregore</a>, who is charged to use that money for the good of the nation. If the purse is significant in value, then the egregore will go to the hakima for advice on how to distribute the money. Though they are not bound to follow this advice (and is quite rare for all the hakima to agree on anything) - it is often the best way to identify where the money might do the most good.
</p><p>If a senator is later <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Revocation" title="Revocation">revoked</a>, the dhomiro does not receive any automatic recompense. Although it should be borne in mind that the egregore has control of the purse, and might choose to offer the dhomiro who appointed a revoked senator some measure of reimbursement, depending on the advice of the hakima.
</p><p>While outsiders may be offended by the way in which the Freeborn auction their senatorial titles, it is a matter of pride that there is comparatively little duplicity in the political achievement of the Freeborn senators. To the Freeborn way of thinking their approach is <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">honest</a> - while the politics of other nations can be devious and underhanded, the Freeborn are forthright and open in the methods employed.
</p><p>You can read much more detail about the ideas and the approach used for the unique Freeborn approach to their senators <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Plutocracy" title="Plutocracy">here</a>.
</p><p>The senators for each Imperial territory are re-elected at specific equinox and solstices during the year. The Senator for <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura" title="Segura">Segura</a> is elected at the Spring equinox, the Senator for <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feroz" title="Feroz">Feroz</a> is elected at the Summer solstice, the Senator for <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman" title="Kahraman">Kahraman</a> is elected at the Autumn equinox, and the Senator for <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga" title="Madruga">Madruga</a> is elected at the Winter solstice.

<p>Jonquil got to his feet, smoothed his robes and clasped his hands behind his back.  Around him the usual murmur of the senate fell quiet, eagerly awaiting the next great clash between the two orators.  Clearing his throat, Jonquil gestured to where Aramaste sat atop a magnificent silk cushion, nibbling daintily on a candied sweetmeat.
</p><p>?My friend?? he smiled, but not warmly, ?I have heard it said that the Brazen ? my apologies, the <em>Freeborn</em> ? will put a price on anything.  Is that true??
</p><p>Aramaste chewed thoughtfully before answering, ?It is the custom amongst my people, yes.?
</p><p>?So, in the spirit of enlightening this august body,? Jonquil leaned in, sensing blood, ?Just how much, exactly, would an enemy of the Empire have to pay you to betray your oaths of office??
</p><p>Indrawn breaths, muttering and gasps of outrage circled the chamber. Jonquil?s smile stretched larger, yet was none the more pleasant for that.
Aramaste?s eyes glittered as he slowly brushed the crumbs from his hands and rose to his feet. ?Ordinarily we Freeborn would say something like 'Every Coin in the Empire', or some other suitably dramatic and impossible sum.?
</p><p>Jonquil interrupted, ?But surely, once you have set a price, we are merely haggling over details?  You?d agree that you would betray the Empire for coin?  I would submit that the amount is immaterial.?
</p><p>?For you, Lord Jonquil, I choose a different price.  I choose all the money your mother can earn in a year of whoring on the docks of Siroc.?
</p><p>Jonquil?s smile quickly turned to a deep scowl, his face becoming an ugly puce.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Money is the most versatile tool in existence. Every Freeborn is to one degree or another looking to ?make their fortune? because wealth brings status and luxury and it gives you a freedom that is denied to the poor.
</p><p>Freeborn traders go beyond the frankness that is normal for everyday Freeborn and strive for a degree of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">honesty</a> that would shame a priest. They regard it as a matter of skill to obtain the best possible price while being utterly open about the goods they sell. This probity is not driven solely by moral concerns, but also practical ones. The Freeborn have achieved an extraordinary reputation for not cheating their customers - a reputation that drives business to their door. Any Freeborn trader who stoops to lying about their merchandise for the sake of a better deal puts the prosperity of all Freeborn at risk. As a result, they protect this reputation very aggressively. Freeborn traders who do seek to twist a deal or sell a light load are dealt with without mercy.
</p><p>About the only things the Freeborn do not buy or sell are slaves. Slavery of Imperial Citizens is illegal in the Empire, and the Freeborn take no part in the trade even when overseas. While the Freeborn do not hold with slavery, they approve of the idea of hard work as punishment, treating the wages a criminal might have earned doing a job honestly as payment towards the resolution of their crime.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Contracts">Contracts</span></h2>
<p>When it comes to making financial agreements more complex than a direct exchange of goods, Freeborn are most comfortable dealing through <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_culture_and_customs#Contracts" title="The Brass Coast culture and customs">contracts</a>. As a consequence, Freeborn merchants usually seek out the services of a professional scrivener to formalise their agreements. A discreet, neutral scrivener can work out and witness a contract that satisfies both parties, and they are very much in demand. Combining the skill to express ideas simply and clearly in writing with a talent for arbitrating between individuals to help them express what they actually want, these scriveners are the backbone of Freeborn economic life.
</p><p>The Freeborn prefer to abide by the letter of a contract, rather than the ?spirit". Arguments about what was ?meant? by the contract are inevitably circular and unhelpful. Where the meaning of a contract must be discussed or clarified, it is again to the professional scrivener that the Freeborn merchant turns. The best scriveners are also artists or employ someone capable of making their contracts look attractive and professional with fine calligraphy and colourful flourishes. A disproportionate number of scriveners are of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Cambion" title="Cambion">cambion</a> lineage. Common superstition suggests that their connection to the Autumn realm helps them to instinctively understand how to frame a contract, and their blood marked on a document is traditionally held to grant good fortune to the enterprise involved.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Paradors">Paradors</span></h2>
<p>When an outsider thinks of a Freeborn trader, they are often thinking of the proprietor of a parador. Brass Coast towns always have at least one parador, a communal social house of music, story-telling, drinking and dance. At the end of a hard day of work, the people of the Freeborn can often be found here discussing their latest ventures or telling extravagant and grand tales of their ancestors, friends and relatives. 
</p><p>As with most Freeborn businesses, a parador is traditionally owned by an extended family which may maintain more than one structure, or operate a ?travelling parador? akin to a circus or fair. In addition to the services and entertainments they provide, the best paradors are places of trade. While a lot of formal business takes place at the bazaar, the parador is where merchants go to relax and it is often where the real business of complex trade takes place. The parador is where merchants can informally come to an agreement concerning more risky ventures, bulk deals and investment opportunities over chilled fruit and wine.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Corsairs">Corsairs</span></h2>
<p>The Freeborn are not the strongest military in the Empire, but there is one area where their strength is uncontested ? on the open seas. Each Freeborn tribe includes dozens of families who make their living as <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Corsair" title="Corsair">corsairs</a>, sea-borne raiders who prey on barbarian shipping passing through the Bay of Catazar. The Freeborn detest piracy, but they regard privateering as a perfectly legitimate form of warfare, albeit a highly profitable one. Corsair groups are usually Freeborn families who own one or more seaworthy vessels. Corsairs are not just privateers, they commonly engage in foreign trade. A common saying suggests that the only difference between a privateer and a merchant is that the privateers get their goods cheaper.
</p><p>In the early days of the Empire, the Freeborn often vied with <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League" title="The League">the League</a> to be the first to forge trade links with the foreign nations who are not hostile to the Empire - and the corsairs regularly acted as guards and escorts to Imperial merchant ships of all nations.

<p>While the Freeborn nation supports two Imperial armies, organised along traditional lines, most Freeborn families encourage their children to practise some martial skills. The Freeborn remember a time when the families were responsible for their own defence and they try to remain prepared in case that day should come again. Those Freeborn who are not career soldiers are by day traders, farmers and labourers, only turning to martial matters when required, though all are ready to do so.
</p><p>Many families maintain a small dedicated fighting force, usually family members who have shown a capacity for martial excellence. These warriors protect Freeborn caravans and settlements from bands of raiding orcs or adventurous bandits. Families take pride in equipping their warriors with the best equipment they can afford. These family warriors often train to fight in heavy armour in close formation. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kohan">Kohan</span></h2>
<p>Centuries ago, the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hakima" title="Hakima">hakima</a> began to gather Freeborn who had been disowned and turned them into a fighting force. By serving their tribe the Freeborn were able to find a way to redeem themselves. These groups were called kohan, meaning without family, and their number has grown considerably over the years. Although they still accept those who have been cast out, most kohan are volunteers, individuals who find such joy in battle that they cannot give it up. They fight for the joy of battle, flinging themselves into combat with a blood-thirsty relish that can easily dispirit an enemy. Kohan often adopt flamboyant costume and grotesque body paint, the better to unnerve their enemies. When they are not fighting they are usually found celebrating their continued survival with that same intensity.
</p>
<div class="captioned-image captioned-image-right"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Kohan.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Kohan.jpg" src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/d8/Kohan.jpg/400px-Kohan.jpg" width="400" height="267" srcset="/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/d8/Kohan.jpg/600px-Kohan.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/d8/Kohan.jpg/800px-Kohan.jpg 2x" /></a><div class="caption">Kohan often wear fearsome facepaint in battle.</div></div>
<p>Groups of kohan usually form loose bands of soldiers who live and fight together, the group serving as a surrogate for the family they have left behind. Groups of kohan are driven by very different reasons but the traditional ones pledge their service directly to a group of hakima. They regard this devotion as a higher calling and see their path as a spiritual one. A ?family? of kohan is generally quite loose, and its membership fluid. Indeed, members may come from any of the three tribes, laying aside tribal rivalries for as long as they are part of a kohan band. Kohan who cannot fight due to pregnancy or injury generally return to their birth family either until they are ready to fight again, and sometimes kohan choose to rejoin their original family permanently.

Many of the soldiers who serve with this army have experience serving as sailors, and the force is supported by a number of boats and ships. The army often takes advantage of this to reinforce and support difficult positions or move quickly to areas where it can do the most good. The experienced privateers who often serve as officers excel at foraging supplies and prior to the Winter Solstice 381YE, the army was known for its enthusiastic <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Army_qualities#Foraging" title="Army qualities">plundering</a> of barbarian territory.

<p>The Freeborn believe their people are shaped from the elements of dust, flame and glass. The eternal wind-blown dust of the plains is their history, the loyalty for family and continuity of their people. The ferocity of flame is their burning passion for life and their bright and unquenchable spirit. The purity of glass is their soul, the reflection of their transparency and once broken can never again be mended. Dishonesty and wickedness shatter your soul and pieces of it are lost with each act of deception.
</p><p>This belief underpins a very personal relationship with matters of faith and the spirit, one that is rarely articulated directly outside of poetry or song. From the outside, the Freeborn seem impious and disrespectful. However the Freeborn have great respect for the paragons and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way" title="The Way">the Way of Virtue</a>, but they have little time for the priests and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Synod" title="The Synod" class="mw-redirect">Synod</a> that exist to mediate ? or dilute - their message. The Synod, with its doctrines and heresies, is often seen as being full of pomposity and self-importance, whereas a truly faithful person understands what is true and what is false in their soul. There is a Freeborn Assembly, but it generally has no formal structure outside of the Synod, being more a collection of individuals. The Freeborn Assembly only tends to come together when there is a matter serious enough to warrant the use of its powers.
</p><p>As a result, Freeborn religious ceremonies tend to place their emphasis on celebration rather than sermons. They celebrate sacred festivals with entertainment, feasting, parties and dancing. Many families include a devout priest or spiritual family member who can be relied on to oversee these indulgences, but for the largest and most important festivities the Freeborn seek out the services of a sutannir.
</p><p>A cross between a professional priest and a party organiser, sutannir conduct important ceremonies such as the coming of age or a wedding, and see to the spiritual needs of the Freeborn as a whole. Before the ceremony, many paint their face and limbs with stylised flames in bright colours and dress in flamboyant costumes. A good sutannir will keep their words short and evocative, knowing audiences prefer to be inspired to virtue rather than lectured. When not speaking they manage the entertainments to make sure that everyone attending is drawn into the celebrations. While it may be the festivity that the Freeborn remember rather than the ceremony, the best sutannir are able to provide religious instruction and support without labouring their point.
</p><p>Coal-walking, fire breathing, fire dancing and other symbolic performances that represent the Freeborn passion for life are always popular at Freeborn religious celebrations. Lone sutannir will hire sufficient entertainers and artisans skilled at these activities to fill the night's entertainment, concentrating on managing their performances to ensure the best overall impact. Sutannir groups usually include numerous talented performers in their ranks who can cover most of the skills most commonly in demand.
</p><p>Sutannir also perform <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_culture_and_customs#Funerals" title="The Brass Coast culture and customs">funeral ceremonies</a>.

<p>Last night, Ramak invited me to what he said was a religious ceremony. This morning, my head is pounding and I will never eat again. We did not talk about Courage, but we danced on fire. We did not contemplate Prosperity, but we enjoyed the finest things from many lands. We did not read about Pride, but sang the songs of our homelands till our throats were hoarse. I can attest the Freeborn care deeply about the fate of their souls ? but they just do not speak of it as we do.

</div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feast_of_the_Broken_Wheel">Feast of the Broken Wheel</span></h2>
<p>The only festival the sutannir do not perform is the Feast of the Broken Wheel, known by many as Fool's Day. On this day, the Freeborn turn virtue on its head and celebrate the contrary. The festival takes place on the second day of the Autumn Equinox, and starts at sunset and lasts until midnight. The proud become humble, ties of loyalty may be ignored, the prosperous become ascetic and the wise act as fools. It is a time of foolishness, pranks and trickery that begins with a symbolic chase, where seven effigies of the paragons are chased from the camp in a gleeful and chaotic parade. Everyone is encouraged to try harmless skills like juggling and music ? the more terrible the performance the more it is applauded. The festival usually ends in a drunken stupor. On Fool's Day, even the most moral Freeborn try their hand at telling untruths and lies - often with comical degrees of success. 
</p><p>The festival is considered blasphemous by some in the Imperial Synod but, to date, the Freeborn Assembly has done little to discourage it, or penalise those involved. Some have argued that, by permitting it, it helps the Freeborn embrace The Way more readily for the rest of the year.

<p>Magic is a source of wonder and pleasure to the Freeborn. They expect people performing magic to entertain, and many Freeborn magicians will enhance their rituals with stage magic tricks simply to please the crowd. Some Freeborn learn a handful of non-magical sleight-of-hand tricks or illusions while a few entertainers specialise enough to develop a whole act.
</p><p>Within a family, there is often at least one individual who has made a more serious study of magic. These individuals accept a responsibility for teaching relatives who are interested in learning a few magical knacks and use their magic to help their family and harm their enemies as well as try to scry the vagaries of fortune and fate. These magicians tend to be practical, and often combine their study of magic with crafting or medicinal lore.
</p><p>Freeborn ritualists practice a tradition that says ritual magic is the act of building up power from the participants and creating a connection to the Realms, rather than the more traditional assumption that the magician draws power down from the Realms to the world. As such, all their rituals attempt to include their bystanders as participants whether that is chanting, clapping or singing.
</p><p>Magicians of each tribe bring a unique perspective to their magical arts.
</p>
<ul><li> The Riqueza perform ritual magic using loud, rhythmic, energetic drumming.</li>
<li> The Guerra prefer physical movement combined with fire and light.</li>
<li> The Erigo use a less energetic style, often accompanying their rituals with soothing, harmonious music.</li></ul>
<p>Most Freeborn ritual groups prefer to work magic at night, in the open air, in the same way <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Founders" title="The Founders">the founders</a> did. 
</p><p>While ritual magicians within a family are hardly unknown, the more powerful and organised magicians in Freeborn society are the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hakima" title="Hakima">hakima</a>. These politically active covens view other Freeborn magicians as unsophisticated dabblers at best, and ignorant meddlers at worst. The hakima are highly skilled practitioners of ritual magic and custodians of magical lore handed down to them by the founders of the tribes. They are dedicated to preserving the integrity of the nation as a whole and regularly look to recruit competent ritual magicians from the tribes into their own circles.
</p><p>More than being just magicians, the hakima exemplify a connection to the founders of the tribes and the history of the Freeborn. They are traditionally held to be wise, able to perceive the larger picture more effectively than most Freeborn who are anchored in more mundane activities. They may be consulted when important decisions need to be made within a family, or when magical assistance is sought. They rarely wait to be consulted, however ? a hakima is likely to be poking around any important business ready to offer a suggestion as to what to do next.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coins">Coins</span></h3>
<p>Coins have power on the Coast, as a portion of the luck and prosperity of their owner rubs off on the coins they carry. Many Freeborn traders keep a coin from a lucky deal, either in perpetuity or as their last coin, and they enjoy telling stories of how they acquired certain coins. There is a long-standing belief that giving a coin of note or significance to a person who is down on their luck will improve their fortunes.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Clothing">Clothing</span></h3>
<p>Any clothing that is worn for a few years or more becomes invested with a person's soul, carrying a portion of their identity with them. Old worn clothes are usually burned, rather than given to the poor like in other lands, to avoid a person's self being lost or stolen. The exception is with children where families may keep a particular precious veil, or rich robe to deliberately pass on the spirit of a respected elder to a young family member.
</p>

<p>Black cloth is the garment of the dead in Freeborn society - it carries you safely into death. Bodies are wrapped in black shrouds when they are burned but black cloth is dangerous to the living. A black gift is any gift of clothing or costume that is black in colour; it is sent as a calculated insult or curse to the recipient. Individuals who offend Freeborn sensibilities beyond the pale find black ribbons, the remains of burned shrouds, nailed to their door, or even worse attached to their clothes, a sign that others wish them dead.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Contracts">Contracts</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_culture_and_customs#Contracts" title="The Brass Coast culture and customs">contract</a> represents a binding agreement between individuals, and sometimes takes on a life of its own. Freeborn stories are rife with examples of villains who break a contract and suffer an ironic, karmic tragedy as a consequence. A properly prepared contract is a physical symbol of an agreement - or an oath, if you will. Tampering with a contract after it has been signed is said to bring bad luck on everyone involved.
</p><p>Any agreement is surrounded by a little of the hearth magic of the contract, provided that all parties involved enter into it openly of their own will - there are also several stories of villains who trick someone into signing an unbalanced or deceptive contract who suffer terrible fates shortly afterwards,

<p><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Cambion" title="Cambion">Cambions</a> have a special place in Freeborn society, a tradition that dates back to the murky prehistory of the Freeborn. According to legend, a particularly clever cambion (whose origin is usually tied to the teller in some way) convinced <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Founders" title="The Founders">the founders</a> to sign a cleverly worded trade agreement. This binding oath is allegedly what has kept the Freeborn together as a people. This story has created a superstition that the blood of a cambion (usually a thumbprint) upon a document of trade will bring good fortune to the signatories. As a result, Freeborn cambion often study to become scriveners.
</p><p>The calm nature of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Merrow" title="Merrow">merrow</a> is at odds with the fiery Freeborn way of life. Merrow rarely find themselves comfortable in Freeborn society and there are few to be found. Many Freeborn parents of a merrow child will take that child to a spire in <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen" title="Urizen">Urizen</a>, where the child will find a better life. There is no shame in this; the Freeborn recognise that a merrow will struggle to find a life in the tribes and encourage the parents to make a decision that is seen as being in the best interests of the child. The parting song <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Without_You" title="Without You">Without You</a> is traditionally associated with this custom.
</p><p>The Freeborn <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Ahraz" title="Emperor Ahraz">Emperor Ahraz i Contero i Guerra</a> freed the orc slaves and was instrumental in bringing them into the Empire. As a people, the Freeborn have a great deal of time for the Imperial Orcs, encouraging them to make a place for themselves. On the whole, the Freeborn prefer to deal with people honestly - whatever they may look like - and consequently they are amongst the folk most likely to treat a non-human individual as an equal.
</p>
<center><h1>The Brass Coast territories</h1></center><p>The Brass Coast is wealthy in vineyards and orchards that produce fortified wines and flowers from which they make rich dyes. The people enjoy strong trade links with foreign nations, allowing them to bring luxuries and commodities to all the people of the Empire (for a price of course!). Textiles, wines and ales from far-off places are prized treasures, but wood is a thing of beauty to the natives of the Coast. Theirs are lands of rolling plains, fertile lowlands with lush vineyards. Although there are orchards of exotic fruit trees the land is devoid of large areas of forest. Early in the history of the Coast they cut down most of their hardwood to build ships and settlements, and the fruit trees that remain are more suited for burning than building. Since fine quality wood is a valuable commodity, dwellings tend to be piled high with rugs, cushions and furs.
</p><p>The towns of the Coast are sprawling, disorganised affairs almost inevitably built around a bustling bazaar. Everything from steel to spices changes hands in these trading hubs and they are festooned with brightly coloured fabrics, gaudily painted signs and exotic wares. Contracts of trade, seals of endorsement and bonds of marque are proudly displayed by vendors who hawk their goods to the people who fill the plazas and streets at all hours. In and around these cosmopolitan bazaars, the wealthiest families maintain sprawling estates. Often plain from the outside, Freeborn structures are alive with ostentation within and lined with ornate tapestries and finery. The most influential Freeborn thread their homes with running water and glittering fountains, sculptures and artefacts crafted from precious materials, beautiful rugs, carpets and hangings, the scents of incense and the sound of music. It is important that a home be beautiful, as well as secure, ?Your home,? as one ancient poet put it, ?should be a comfort to your body, and a balm to your soul.?

The clothing, designed to be grown into, carries the memory of the lost relative and is believed to help the child develop wisdom, audacity and courage of their forebear. The clothing is usually tied up in some way, to ensure it does not drag in the mud.
<p>Freeborn like children to learn the value of money. Those who are not poor give their children a Ring every morning, to carry with them during the day. The child is expected to give the Ring back at night, or to justify why they spent the money if it is gone. Any money that the child makes using their Ring is theirs to keep.
</p><p>If a child loses their parents, they will always find a home somewhere among their extended family. However, because of the strength of Freeborn family bonds, if a child is truly orphaned without another family member to take them in, they may end up destitute and face a grim future unless taken in by another family, a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr" title="Navarr">Navarr</a> Striding or the Church of the Little Mother.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Style_summary">Style summary</span></h3>
<p>Like the Freeborn themselves, their music is rhythmic, vigorous and fiery. Waily reeded or brass instruments, rich vocal harmonies and the strumming of strings resound in counterpoint with the ever-present syncopation of drums, tambourines and claves. It is said a Freeborn will make an instrument out of anything - hands, cutlery, tables and crockery are all used to enthusiastically accompany performers. Their vocal tradition involves not only the singing of complex melodies and accompaniment but also encourages others to join in ululating harmonies, drones and chants. The overall impression is vibrant, noisy and enthusiastic - music, like everything in their lives, is to be savoured to the utmost.
</p><p>Brass Coast music draws on the real world inspiration of Corsican music, Spanish Pilgrim songs, Italian lauda, and New World sea shanties. Although they are a seafaring nation, more traditional English shanties (such as Poor Tom Bowling, The Mermaid etc.) would be better suited to the musical tradition of the Marches.

<li> Rhythms could be much lighter than other nations, keep them syncopated (off beat), and on tambourines, castanets, shakers, or light drums. Keep your playing light and bouncy!</li>

<center><h1>The Brass Coast costumes</h1></center><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>This page aims to offer help in creating a Brass Coast costume for those who want it. It provides a list of resources that players looking to create a costume, either purchasing one or making one may find useful. There is no one way to create the perfect costume, but the suggestions on this page will help to produce a great costume for Empire.
</p><p>The Brass Coast offers a chance to create some flamboyant and really expressive costumes. The Freeborn attitude to life is all about individuality, passion and luxury, and many Freeborn express this through their dress. Success is measured in wealth, and what better way to demonstrate that wealth than by wearing it openly? The Freeborn look is usually one of bright colours, silks, jewels and sumptuousness. Individual style is highly valued and the mundane and common scorned. The Brass Coast lives for dance and music, and the clothing worn there often reflects this. With the flame being the central symbol for the Freeborn, it?s no surprise to find that their clothing is made in brightly coloured layers to convey the impression of the fire within.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="10_Quick_Tips">10 Quick Tips</span></h2>
<ul><li> Generally, an outfit is likely to consist of trousers, top, a robe of some sort and a headdress.</li>
<li> A great way to achieve the richness and the movement in Freeborn style is through costume in multiple layers - working from heavier warm layers as a base and floating fabrics as a top layer.</li>
<li> To cope with the British climate, fleeces are ideal as linings for more flamboyant fabrics, and light wools can be dressed with metallic brocades or embroidery. Multiple layers of silks are also surprisingly effective at keeping out the cold.</li>
<li> Bright colours layered together can give a wonderful range of shades which alter as the wearer moves - or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_silk" rel="nofollow" class="external text">?shot?<i class="icon-share-alt"></i></a> fabrics, also called ?changeant? can look incredible in flowing robes, scarves and skirts.</li>
<li> Whilst the style and clothing inspirations are Moorish and North African, the colours, beading and embroidery of sari and other fabrics widely available in Asian clothing shops across the UK so these can be a great source of materials. Shalwar Kameez can be a useful base layer.</li>
<li> Both charity shops and on-line stores can be good sources of Arabic and North African loose tunics and trousers - often in white cotton which will dye well in bright colours.</li>
<li> To really keep the flowing feel of Freeborn style, try avoiding heavy belts and instead secure layers of clothing with scarves; hanging pouches and scabbards from the shoulder on cords or jewelled chains. </li>
<li> Integrating the flow of jewellery with the flow of the costume is another strong marker of the Brass Coast, and internet suppliers of belly dancing costume, as well as markets and shops near Asian areas, can be a good place to find long strings of coins, bells and other adornments.</li>
<li> Try Asian shops for slipper shoes, or look for patterns for making Greek or Roman sandals which lace up the leg - both are common footwear for the Freeborn</li>
<li> If all this talk of silks and brocades is sounding a little pricey - check out the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/A_guide_to_fabrics_for_kitmaking" title="A guide to fabrics for kitmaking">fabric pages</a> to see how impressive effects can be achieved without spending a fortune</li></ul>

<p>To create loose and flowing trousers any of these patterns work well. Variation can be added by ending the trousers just past the knee or by slitting the leg to reveal jewellery or another layer of colour.

<p>A simple T-tunic will work well in the Brass Coast, with Freeborn touches achieved by adding decoration, particularly around the neck and keeping this base slim fitting so other layers can flow over it.

<p>There are several different styles of long robe which work well for over layers.
This garment is based on either the traditional kaftan, or the thobe. To give it strong Freeborn flavour  the colours would be bright and slits to knee or hip would reveal layers beneath.

<p>A more dress-like version of the tunic is the anarkali suit, which is a high waisted dress with a full skirt to knee or calf, worn over trousers. A similar garment from Morocco is called the el-keswa.

<p>A melia is a traditional Tunisian dress/robe, which is simply fabric pinned at the shoulders and either left hanging or be belted to the body, much like a Roman Stola. The Freeborn are likely to wear it over tunic style top and trousers rather than on its own.

<p>Children are an opportunity for parents to show off their wealth, dressing their offspring in traditional Freeborn styles. Children in the Brass Coast are often dressed in scaled down versions of their parents clothes.
</p><p>For toddlers and babies, simple t-tunics and drawstring trousers are simple and easy to pull-on garments, that can be made in linen or cotton for easy washing! These types of clothes also have plenty of flexibility in terms of size, meaning they should last for more than one year. Choosing sleeveless and none form fitted top layers like the melia/stola should make several years of wear possible, making fancy trims and embellishments worthwhile.
</p><p>General tips for costume for children: 
</p>
<ul><li> Robes that stop at knee - mid-calf will be less of a trip hazard</li>
<li> Headgear that can be very simply retied is great</li>
<li> Avoiding things that can pull around the neck is wise (strings on cloaks/hats on cords/ tabards that don't secure under the arms</li>
<li> Wider neck holes, sleeves and armholes will help with getting costume on and off, and leave room for growth</li></ul>

<p>The colour palette is inspired by flame, but it also features other sumptuous colours -such as turquoise, magenta, emerald green and peacock blue. Note the absence of black - reserved for the dead and white - worn only by the very poorest.
