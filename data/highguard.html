<p>The Highborn are a people supremely confident of their own place in history.  They revere the highest ideals, to epitomize <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way" title="The Way">Imperial Virtues</a>, to reflect the noble obligations of leadership and thereby to embody the very spirit of the Empire. They created <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Synod" title="The Synod" class="mw-redirect">the Synod</a> so that they might stand vigil over the collective soul of the Empire. Their manifest destiny is to drive the barbarians from the land and unite all humankind; they will accept nothing less.
</p><p>The children of Highguard are a blazing beacon of righteousness in a dark and grimy world that too often chooses to take the easy way, to reach a compromise with vice. They stand against the tide of wickedness and say "No. This is not acceptable. We can be better." Regiments of disciplined soldiers march to battle, shoulder to shoulder, determined to take the fight to the enemies of civilisation. Their first thoughts and their last are for their beloved Empire, and they know that even if they are struck down a life of virtue will see them reborn once more, given another chance to bring humankind to its shining destiny.
</p><p>The <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapters" title="Chapters" class="mw-redirect">chapters</a>, the great stone settlements in which most Highborn dwell, are scattered across the plains that lie between Urizen and the Bay of Catazar. Many are built on ancient battle sites, scenes of triumph in the historic wars that wrested control of the land from the barbarians. All are heavily fortified, with granite quarried from the southern mountains, for the Highborn will brook no expense to protect what is theirs. ?Wood burns, stone endures? is an old Highborn aphorism that says much about their perspective.
</p><p>Although the First Empress put aside her nationality when she united the Empire, the Highborn consider their nation the proud parent of the Empire, and themselves to be its founders, tutors and guardians. They protect the Empire with their armies, guide its hand in <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Senate" title="The Senate" class="mw-redirect">the Senate</a> and guard its soul in the Synod; perhaps most important of all, they keep the Imperial Histories to record and tell of the deeds that make the Empire great.
</p>
<div class="ic"><div class="ic-inner quote"><p>?This is Highguard, the birthplace of the Empire. Our people, the Highborn, are the Empire?s proud parents, devoted lovers, stalwart protectors and wise guides.

<ul><li> <b>We made the Empire.</b> The First Empress was Highborn. She pulled the scattered human nations together and enlightened them to the true faith.</li>
<li> <b>Only actions are virtuous.</b> Thoughts and feelings are never virtuous or vile. It is only the actions that you undertake that demonstrate your worth.</li>
<li> <b>The purpose of the past is to inspire the present.</b> We study history not to argue over the facts but to identify lessons that can inspire us today.</li>
<li> <b>Virtue and vice are contagious.</b> A virtuous life leads the faithful to further righteous action but vile behaviour spreads just as easily if not checked.</li>
<li> <b>A chapter is bound by spirit, not blood.</b> Amongst the Highborn family ties matter less than shared belief, purpose and vision.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_the_Highborn_are_not">What the Highborn are not</span></h2>
<ul><li> <b>Zealots or Bigots.</b> There are zealots in Highguard but as a nation they strive to be righteous and lead by example; they are not self-righteous and condemnatory. </li>
<li> <b>Christian crusaders.</b> Highguard is partly inspired by the imagery and themes of the crusades but there are major differences between Highborn chapters and the crusading orders. Most specifically Christian iconography is inappropriate here.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The Highborn have always known their destiny. From the first, they brought civilisation, and carved a nation from the wilderness, driving the barbarians before them as they expanded. This civilisation, intimately connected to their notion of Virtue, has only grown and strengthened over the years, finally reaching its maturity at the birth of the First Empress and the formation of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way" title="The Way">Imperial Creed</a>.
</p><p>Most dwell in <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapters" title="Chapters" class="mw-redirect">chapters</a>, fortified settlements spread across the plains and linked by roads, rivers and canals. The chapters are united by a common purpose, a creed that defines their own subtle interpretation of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way" title="The Way">the Way of Virtue</a>. The Highborn pride themselves on the strong sense of community within a chapter. They work together and often eat together, meeting daily in the chapterhouse for prayers and to break fast. 
</p><p>It is said ? only half in jest ? that every Highborn, no matter what their calling, is also part-soldier and part-priest. The grain of truth at the heart of the proverb is that the Highborn are raised from a young age not to take what they have for granted, but to be constantly alert to threats both martial and spiritual.
</p>

<p>Highguard is a distinguished nation. Their days of rapid change, hurried conquest and shifting rulerships are behind them, and their culture has reached a pinnacle of insight and stability. The Highborn are proud of their accomplishments; if they are wary of change it is because they have worked so hard to achieve what they have. This caution has served them well through the founding and expansion of the Empire, allowing them to strengthen their culture and faith without the dilution of barbarian customs. Their love for Imperial civilisation drives them to defend it from those who would diminish it ? whether invading foreigners, well-meaning Imperial converts or the sinister eternals.
</p><p>Although the Highborn are justifiably proud of their role in creating the Empire, they are vigilant against the vices of hubris and indulgence. In Highguard, everyone must do their part to ensure the triumph of nation and Empire. Those that are raised up to positions of power are expected to do more than most. To the Highborn way of thinking, senators and the like are the servants of the Empire, hand-picked by the citizens to display moral rectitude and provide leadership. With power comes a tremendous responsibility: to be decisive and proactive, to use the power you have been given to benefit all. Those who use such positions to make themselves wealthy or idle are regarded with contempt.
</p><p>A sense of history is profoundly important to the Highborn. More than the dry recording of facts, Highborn history is explicitly written as a chronicle to inspire future generations. Elements such as an invigorating narrative, a strong central character, and an enlightening lesson are considered far more important than useless ? or worse, negative ? details. Highborn scholars consider speculation over the accuracy of any given historical account (all of which are by their nature subjective) pointless, and instead focus on its relevance as a lesson to the present and future. This has been known to bring them into conflict with the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_Magical_Traditions" title="Urizen Magical Traditions" class="mw-redirect">Urizen archivists</a>. The Highborn abhor the indiscriminate Urizen approach to source material and their refusal to apply a rigorous moral judgement to what they record and propagate.

<p>Highguard first names are primarily Old Testament Biblical in flavour. 
</p><p>They are chosen carefully for the child in order to establish the appropriate resonance and also consideration of the surname they will bear. Within a chapter there is usually little need for a second name, where there is confusion people often identify the specific individual by referencing a notable parent, i.e. Dinah, daughter of Eli.
</p><p>When being formally introduced or described to people from outside a chapter, it is customary to append the individual's chapter to their name, reinforcing that it is the community in which the Highborn is a member that is more important than matters of blood. Chapters themselves are normally named after their founder and where, or why, they were founded, i.e. Ezekiel's Guard or Rebekah's Haven.
</p><p>This means a Highborn might be called, for instance, Dinah of Ezekiel's Guard or Saul of Rebekah's Haven, using the previous chapters. If the Highborn changes chapter, for some reason, it is normal to take a completely new name to represent the change of direction in the individual.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Washing_and_cleanliness">Washing and cleanliness</span></h2>
<p>Cleanliness is important to the Highborn. Highborn bathhouses are complex affairs with steam rooms, cold plunge pools, as well as heated baths and massage tables. A Highborn?s first impulse on arriving somewhere after a journey is to clean away the dust of the road. Small fountains, pools and fonts are commonly found outside Highborn chapterhouses, and even individual homes, so that those entering can perform a token cleansing of hands and face. Scented finger-bowls are common between courses at a meal.
</p><p>In foreign lands or on campaign, cleanliness can be more difficult to maintain. If limited clean water is available, most Highborn will preserve the ritual aspects of washing, such as flicking a few drops over head and shoulders, dabbing a little on the eyes and forehead, or merely wetting the tips of fingers. If no clean water is available, symbolic gestures are performed instead; raising both hands to the face, then passing them over the head is a gesture that means ?I would wash myself if I had water.? This gesture is occasionally used to mean ?I wash my hands of this situation? and can even be used during an argument to express a sentiment roughly equivalent to ?I am tired of you and want you gone?.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Recording_history">Recording history</span></h2>
<p>Personal, as well as national, history is important to the Highborn. Many Highborn keep journals - diaries or collections of letters are the most common forms. These writings may be private, but it is also common for Highborn who are away from home to write short pieces intended to be shared with friends and family - reading travelogues and biographies are popular pastimes. The best writings are those that are considered to give a very personal viewpoint on events. Full of passion, they let the reader share the insights of the writer, and empathise with their emotions.  
</p><p>On death these personal writings are usually bequeathed either to a favoured family member or to the Stewards of the Dead, to form part of the library at the heart of the Necropolis. It is considered a great honour for an individual?s thoughts and experiences to be preserved as an inspiration and guide to future generations.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Competition_and_skill">Competition and skill</span></h2>
<p>Not all Highborn are warriors, but most enjoy competition, whether tests of fitness, skill or intellect. Especially popular at present is the Cathleon, a challenge based on a training regime favoured by many of the Unconquered, consisting of a footrace, javelin throws and a second footrace. The entire event is run in a single sequence, testing speed, skill and endurance. To win, the victor must run to the target, throw three javelins through a target hoop and then return to the start. There are no set distances or target-sizes; the competitors agree these details before a Cathleon begins.
</p><p>Physical prowess is not the only way to earn respect from Highborn. Prestige lies in skill with tactical games such as chess, backgammon, othello, draughts, tafl and go. They also enjoy wagering on these games, although there is a general distaste for games of pure chance such as roulette or dice.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Art">Art</span></h2>
<p>Mosaics are popular, their swirling patterns recall the winds and the tides; at their hearts, stylised representations of the heroes of old. Vast and vaulted marble domes; dusty cloisters smelling of old parchment; cool villas with fountains at their heart fill the household with the song of the water. An artistic movement has been growing over the last two decades that moves away from the traditional complex mosaics towards a simpler style involving the shaping of coloured stone to fit together in designs reminiscent of stained glass ? a more elegant and modern refinement of an ancient art. 
</p><p>Highborn musical traditions favour the flute and other wind instruments. On days when the wind is high, a chapterhouse resounds with the song of wind chimes, aeolian harps and bells.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_cowl">The cowl</span></h2>
<p>Before the dissolution of the Patrician Council, the tradition amongst the Highborn was that those carrying out funerary rites went hooded when doing so as a mark of respect. When the Navigator dissolved the Council, he did so hooded, a gesture believed to indicate the Council?s ?death?. Since that time, a practice has arisen amongst many Highborn, particularly those in authority, to wear hoods or cowls, usually in the colours of their Chapter. The custom has it that when the hood is down, the wearer is speaking informally as themselves, but with the hood up they speak formally, such as representing others or passing a judgement. The act of raising or lowering the hood can, in such cases, change the atmosphere in a room significantly, and there are few sights as intimidating as a group of hooded Highborn moving with purpose.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Funerals">Funerals</span></h2>
<p>Death is an important moment in each spirit's cycle, with an opportunity to celebrate the virtues shown in the life that has now passed and meditate on whether the spirit might at last escape the Labyrinth. Mourners customarily wear sombre veils and cowls. Traditionally the dead have their hands and face carefully washed once they are in repose. They are then veiled for a final time and each person who has something to say upon the virtue of the individual takes their turn before the will of the deceased is read aloud. Bells are tolled throughout the proceedings to carry the words to the dead. 
</p><p>Testaments are common in Highguard. It is normal for bequests to be made on the basis of the virtues displayed by the recipient, rather than on any ties of blood. Any remaining chattels are gathered by the Chapter itself. All of this is done with some haste so that the body may be properly prepared for internment within their Chapter's mausoleum or, if they are particularly virtuous, within the Necropolis itself. Regardless of whether mortal remains are involved every Highborn wants their name inscribed on a monument in the Necropolis. Those of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Briar" title="Briar">briar</a> <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lineage" title="Lineage">lineage</a> are almost never interred; their bodies are burnt and the ashes scattered over water.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Day_of_the_Dead">Day of the Dead</span></h2>
<p>Taking place on the second day of the Winter equinox, the Day of the Dead is an important celebration that serves as a memorial for those lost in the preceding year. Respects are paid throughout the day with Chapters remembering those they have lost in their own traditional sombre and serious manner until dusk comes. As light fades from the sky it is common for the Highborn to begin a candle- and lantern-lit slow procession around their homes or <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapter" title="Chapter">chapterhouses</a>. The celebrants walk in silence except for the intoning of bells or the speaking of the names of those who have passed into the Labyrinth; the procession often visits places that were important to a deceased individual in life. 
</p><p>Once the procession is complete, a celebration of those lives usually begins with songs and stories of the virtues of the Highborn. It is common for friends and loved-ones to share anecdotes and readings from their own journals or letters, or those of the departed. 
</p><p>The following morning is often used to celebrate those who have been born to, or joined, the nation in the last year, with many taking the opportunity to re-swear their oaths to Chapters and to Nation. It is also a common that Highborn give small meaningful gifts on this day, the most precious ones being considered by some to be those made by the gift-giver.
</p><p>In pre-Imperial times, midnight on the Day of the Dead marked the end of one year and the beginning of the next. Old Highborn documents (and some traditionalist historians) still count the Day of the Dead as the last day of the year which can occasionally lead to confusion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The Highborn look is generally practical and restrained. Its beauty is in the small touches ? the geometric trim on the robes, the exquisite jewelry. Colours are deliberately stark and contrasting, and outfits in black and white are commonplace. Many members of a chapter choose to adopt similar garb, with the symbol of their chapter displayed prominently on the chest, shoulders, or at the breast. This is particularly true for Highborn warriors who show their solidarity and loyalty with their fellows by marching into battle decked in identical garb. Of all the nations of the Empire, the Highborn are the most inclined to uniformity, a visible display of their inner commitment to their shared faith and destiny.
</p><p>Rather than displaying impractical frivolity in the cut of their garments, Highborn show their taste and wealth in jewellery, and the decoration of cloth. Jewelled and embellished trims at the hems of garments are popular, as is the intricate braiding of hair and heavy, elaborate jewellery.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Armour">Armour</span></h2>
<p>Highborn armour tends to be full length and layered or segmented. Heavy black leather is common, sometimes with pieces of plate worn over it. The Unconquered usually leave their head uncovered, but Cataphracts favour a full helm, ideally decorated with wings. Carved or decorated black vambraces are often worn for additional protection.
</p><p>Traditional lorica in hard leather or metal can work for Highborn, particularly if the suit is tooled or decorated or the outfit incorporates a Highborn style surcoat or cloak.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Surcoats">Surcoats</span></h3>
<p>Most Highborn warriors cover their armour with a long flowing surcoat. The ideal surcoat is black or white with a design in a stark contrasting colour. The Crusader knights exemplify this tradition in real history, although an original design for a chapter?s emblem is preferable.
</p><p>Uniforms for some Highborn chapters include cloaks with the chapter?s emblem repeated on each shoulder.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_founding">The founding</span></h3>
<p>Seven centuries ago, the Highborn arrived on the Bay of Catazar. Seventeen great vessels carrying pure souls crossed the sea from the south looking for new lands. They left behind a land and people slowly being consumed by corruption and darkness. They were steered by the legendary Navigators, a pair of visionary twins named Atuman and Atun who were later acknowledged as an Exemplar of Ambition and a Paragon of Wisdom respectively.
</p><p>Upon landing, Atuman founded the city of Pharos at the mouth of the river Couros. Atun ? following a vision of her own ? took only the flagship, bade her brother farewell and set sail, never to be seen again.
</p><p>The navigators of the first vessels formed a council of patricians to advise Atuman the Navigator. After his death his eldest daughter, Acenath, took the title of navigator and ruled in his place while the patricians also named heirs from amongst their offspring. The council ruled wisely for many years but as the generations passed the navigator and the patricians became more obsessed with preserving their power and their bloodlines and degenerated into self-interest and corruption.
</p><p>During this time, trade with the Navarr introduced the Highborn to vinum, a herb which was used medicinally and recreationally. However, the Scions of Atun, a group of ascetics and mystics, discovered a process of refining into a substance called liao. They used liao to experience visions, and in other ceremonies, that revealed the Labyrinth of Ages. This enlightenment, about the immortal nature of the human spirit and the power of virtue, sparked a period of time now referred to as the Revelation.
</p><p>The Revelation stirred a spiritual yearning within the people and swept across the land, awakening many to a new and profound understanding of life. This awakening was further fuelled by widespread disillusionment with the venal ways of the patricians. The Scions and other groups born of the Revelation left Pharos, sicked by the corruption that riddled the city. Along the borders of the nation they built their own communities, called <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapters" title="Chapters" class="mw-redirect">chapters</a>, each dedicated to teaching a profound way of living inspired by the Revelation and guarding against corruption.
</p><p>As the chapters grew, the patricians became jealous of their influence and passed laws to try to control them. Things came to a head in the time of the Navigator <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Permion" title="Permion">Permion</a>, who later generations would call the Lawmaker ? a Navigator who strove to serve the people rather than his own interest. Permion sought to reach out to the leaders of the chapters, starting with the most influential, <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lepidus" title="Lepidus">Lepidus</a> of the Seven Stars. Lepidus is now acknowledged as a Paragon of Pride. He taught Permion about the greatness of the Highborn, what they had been and could be again, and helped him find the will to oppose the wickedness of the patricians.

<div class="captioned-image captioned-image-right"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Highguard.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Highguard.jpg" src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/fe/Highguard.jpg/350px-Highguard.jpg" width="350" height="482" srcset="/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/fe/Highguard.jpg/525px-Highguard.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/fe/Highguard.jpg/700px-Highguard.jpg 2x" /></a><div class="caption"></div></div>
<p>Permion the Lawmaker's judgements and actions brought the patricians into conflict with him and also with each other. Rather than allow the nation to fall into anarchy, Permion declared martial law and dissolved the Patrician Council. In its place, he invited the chapters to form an Assembly of the Virtuous to advise him.
</p><p>The response of the Patrician Council was swift and bloody, and a bitter civil war ensued. Permion was assassinated, along with his wife and three of his four children. Various patricians tried to claim the title of navigator and the city of Pharos was burned to the ground by rival armies. Eventually the Assembly was forced to act. After mobilizing the military strength of the chapterhouses it crushed the remaining patrician forces and assumed the governance of the nation. Today, the Lawmaker is recognised as an influential Exemplar of Courage.
</p><p>The Assembly of the Virtuous elected to turn the ruins of Pharos into the Necropolis, a great mausoleum to house the bodies of all those slain in the war. They also ordered the construction of Bastion, a new city which would serve as a civic and religious centre for the Highborn thereafter and vowed that no Highborn would ever war with other Highborn again.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_horses_of_Highguard">The horses of Highguard</span></h3>
<p>The Highborn fleet carried with them a great herd of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Horses" title="Horses">horses</a>. These legendary beasts embodied noble virtues of loyalty, strength and dignity. Mounted on their mighty warhorses, the Highborn were unbeaten in battle and the creatures became the iconic symbol of the nation, reflecting the martial spirit of the people. The venal ways of the patricians caused the herds to dwindle until none remained and since the dawn of the Empire they have passed into legend. Highborn parents tell their children the tale of the loss of their horses to teach them never to take blessings for granted.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_First_Empress">The First Empress</span></h3>
<p>The First Empress was Highborn, and the last to ride a legendary Highborn steed. After taking liao, she revealed that all human souls are re-incarnated on the same wheel, regardless of whether they were Highborn. Therefore, to preserve the future of Highguard and enlighten all worthy human souls, it was essential to unite all of humanity under a single banner, such that Highborn reborn elsewhere would still come to know their heritage and the Way of Virtue. From Highborn faith, the Empire came into being, changing the face of the world forever.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Highborn_on_the_Throne">Highborn on the Throne</span></h2>
<p>Aside from the First Empress, two other Highborn have sat on the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Throne" title="The Throne">Imperial Throne</a>. 
</p><p><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Aenea" title="Empress Aenea">Empress Aenea</a> was appointed in 103YE, and instituted a wide-scaled program of public works.

Her reign is also marked by conflict - she had little interest in <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Foreign_nations" title="Foreign nations">foreign affairs</a>, being focused entirely on building and strengthening the Empire.
</p><p><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Barabbas" title="Emperor Barabbas">Emperor Barabbas</a> took the throne in 180YE, and like his predecessor he focused on strengthening and expanding the Empire. Unlike Aenea, whose interests were very much in the land and its structures, he was fascinated by the sea. An ambitious and charismatic man, he had a vision of an Empire that dominated the entire Bay of Catazar. He is best known today for the manner of his <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Barabbas#Death_and_Legacy" title="Emperor Barabbas">death</a> - lost at sea during a terrible storm along with the great armada he had nearly bankrupted the Empire to create. While modern historians are not kind to Barabbas, the Highborn are often quick to point out that his reign was also a time of great Imperial <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambition" title="Ambition">Ambition</a> and a period of expansion and improved emphasis on securing diplomatic relations with foreign powers.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Archivists">Archivists</span></h3>
<p>Highguard looks to the past to understand the present and predict the future. Its scholars, priests and wizards thirst for tomes and artefacts that reflect on the Empire. There is a roaring trade in books, scrolls and tablets, the more obscure the better. While relics of the holy prophets or antique magical articles are valuable in and of themselves, high prices are also paid for tangible evidence of past life experiences.
</p><p>Archivists collect the histories of Highguard, and of the Empire. They see history as a story that exists not to record dead facts, but to inspire the living. As a consequence, facts that undermine the central truth of an event or the life of a historical character are actually dangerous. A new fact that suggests a wise historical judge never existed, or that a brave general was actually a coward, could do irreparable damage. It could destroy the faith of the living in the individual hero but also undermine the very idea of learning the lessons from history. Destroying or discrediting such lies is as important as revealing the facts that encourage and inspire the living.
</p><p>This means the Highborn archivists are often at odds with their counterparts in other nations, especially the Urizen <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_Magical_Traditions#Seers" title="Urizen Magical Traditions" class="mw-redirect">seers</a> and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_Leadership#Torchbearers" title="Urizen Leadership" class="mw-redirect">torchbearers</a>. In recording and publicizing ?facts?, without applying any moral judgement, Urizen historians deny the inspiration offered by history and its role in making the present and the future better. A common rumour suggests that Highborn archivists maintain hidden storehouses of knowledge deemed too dangerous for the common people. This rumour is baseless. If a piece of information uncovered is considered dangerous to the Empire, it is destroyed so that no future generation can be harmed by its rediscovery.
</p><p>Archivists are romantic figures in Highguard. While the truth is that many of them are quiet scholars and scribes, the popular image is of them as active, energetic people who go to dangerous locations to retrieve valuable information or artefacts for the good of the nation and the Empire as a whole. They face danger frequently, and often have to work against those who want to foolishly spread dangerous information or unleash deadly magic.

<center><h1>Highguard leadership</h1></center><div class="captioned-image captioned-image-right"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Exarch.jpg" class="image" title="Exarchs provide civic and moral leadership to their chapter"><img alt="Exarchs provide civic and moral leadership to their chapter" src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/8/84/Exarch.jpg/350px-Exarch.jpg" width="350" height="525" srcset="/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/8/84/Exarch.jpg/525px-Exarch.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/8/84/Exarch.jpg 2x" /></a><div class="caption">Jada, of the Scions of Ravensfell</div></div>
<p>Most Highborn live in or near one of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapters" title="Chapters" class="mw-redirect">chapters</a>, the great walled settlements, that are spread across the plains that surround the river Couros. Each is a fully functional community incorporating families and individuals from all walks of life, who share a common set of beliefs in the form of a creed. 
</p><p>Each chapter chooses one of their own, called an exarch, to provide the chapter with civic and moral leadership. The exarch is most commonly the one who best embodies the chapter?s creed; a priest or one who has been schooled in philosophy and faith is usually chosen. As a result, most Highborn who are politically ambitious begin by seeking training as a priest. Highborn history clearly shows the perils of choosing a leader who is not virtuous, so they make no apology for placing this criterion above any other. 
</p><p>The holy city of Bastion is the capital of the nation. Every chapter maintains a hostel of some kind here, so that members who make the pilgrimage have somewhere to stay. At one time the Assembly of the Virtuous would meet here regularly to decide the business of the state. When Highguard agreed to join the Empire, the Assembly of the Virtuous was used as the cornerstone for the Imperial Synod, becoming the Highborn Assembly wholesale, and spreading the mandate to watch for any sign of moral decay in the soul of the Empire.
</p><p>Most political business moved to the Senate after the creation of the Empire so those members of the Highborn Assembly interested in politics now meet when the Imperial Court meets, the better to appoint Highborn Senators. Bastion is no longer the seat of government of the Highborn Nation, but it remains the spiritual home of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way" title="The Way">the Way of Virtue</a> and pilgrims from all over the Empire travel here.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Leading_a_territory">Leading a territory</span></h2>
<p>In the days before the Empire the Exarchs were subject to the approval of the Assembly of the Virtuous, to ensure that chapters were led by devout individuals. That power lapsed generations ago; now only the senators come before the Assembly for ratification.
</p><p>The Highborn Assembly selects senators by interrogation. Each chapter whose <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapter" title="Chapter">chapterhouse</a> is in the contested <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Territory" title="Territory">territory</a> may put forward a single candidate for consideration by the Assembly. Chapters are assumed to have sufficient wisdom to be able to select their most virtuous member. On the rare occasion where a chapter is unable to pick a single candidate, they forfeit their right to be considered during that election.
</p><p>Candidates come before the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Assemblies_of_the_Synod#The_National_Assemblies" title="The Assemblies of the Synod" class="mw-redirect">Highborn Assembly</a> where they are expected to answer questions designed to assess their moral rectitude. The Assembly does not exclusively select priests to high office, but it is clear that those who have priestly training have a considerable advantage in answering the moral dilemmas and philosophical questions put to them. After examining the candidates, each member of the Assembly secretly votes to indicate which candidate they felt was least virtuous. The candidate with the least votes against them is then declared the winner. If two or more candidates receive equal fewest votes, then all other candidates are eliminated and another round of voting takes place.
</p><p>The senators for each Imperial territory are re-elected at specific equinox and solstices during the year. The senator for <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos" title="Reikos">Reikos</a> is elected at the Spring equinox, the senator for <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion" title="Bastion">Bastion</a> is elected at the Summer solstice, the senator for <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea" title="Casinea">Casinea</a> is elected at the Autumn equinox, and the senator for <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis" title="Necropolis">Necropolis</a> is elected at the Winter solstice.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tallying_the_votes">Tallying the votes</span></h3>
<p>Every Highborn character with a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Congregation" title="Congregation">congregation</a> is automatically a member of the national assembly.

Votes in the synod gained from a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sinecure" title="Sinecure">sinecure</a> or other Imperial title do not count during the election of a Highguard senator.

<center><h1>Highguard economic interests</h1></center><div class="ic"><div class="ic-inner quote"><p>?The pursuit of wealth is the foundation of suffering.?</p></div></div>
<div class="captioned-image captioned-image-right"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:ProsperityCantiarch.png" class="image" title="Lyaconia of Cantiarch&#39;s Hold considers her next move."><img alt="Lyaconia of Cantiarch&#39;s Hold considers her next move." src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/1/1c/ProsperityCantiarch.png/500px-ProsperityCantiarch.png" width="500" height="428" srcset="/mediawiki-public/images/1/1c/ProsperityCantiarch.png 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/1/1c/ProsperityCantiarch.png 2x" /></a><div class="caption">The Prosperous are not selfish; all that is worthwhile is shared with those who deserve it.</div></div>
<p>There is a deep-seated distrust of the pursuit of wealth for its own sake amongst the Highborn. Highguard is founded on the concept that only action can be virtuous, and their culture rewards assiduous effort and self-improvement. ?Wealth? by itself is a passive force; usury ? charging interest on a loan ? is considered despicable because the lender has no active role in what transpires.
</p><p>In place of the moneylenders common elsewhere, the Highborn are proud of their <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Benefactors" title="Benefactors" class="mw-redirect">benefactors</a>. Often older merchants, benefactors make their wealth work for themselves and others. They try to encourage virtue by acting as patrons to other merchants. They may help a young trader get established, or participate in a risky but ambitious venture that has potential benefits beyond purely economic ones. Rather than lending money and charging interest, benefactors invest in enterprises and in individuals, sharing the risk ? and sharing the profits.
</p><p>Gambling on games of chance is as dubious as usury, since there is no action the participants can take to improve their chances of winning other than to cheat. That said, the Highborn love to wager on contests of skill, whether they are participating or not. Professional book-keepers collect wagers and distribute winnings, taking a small percentage for their service; some specialise in organising contests and competitions specifically to encourage wagering.
</p><p>Permanence is a civic virtue in Highguard and there is no doubt that the nation produces the best architects and masons in the Empire. The quarries of Casinea produce a breathtakingly beautiful marble that absorbs heat when it is warm and exudes it when cold, making it the ideal building material. Other crafts include the creation of decorative mosaics and fabrics with complex geometric patterns. The Highborn also produces fine quality paper and coloured inks, used extensively to record the histories and archives of the nation.

<p>Highguard has a military heritage of which it is justly proud. Most Highborn serve with one of the three Highborn armies as part of their ?coming-of-age?. This service is considered necessary to the formation of Highborn character and maintains the connection between the people of today and their warrior ancestry. Most skills can be put to use in a military context, although those serving as medics, quartermasters and ancillary troops do not earn as much respect as their more warlike colleagues.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Guardians">Guardians</span></h2>
<p>Most Highborn return to their <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapter" title="Chapter">chapter</a> after leaving the army. The most skilled soldiers become part of the elite guards that protect the chapter against barbarians and other threats. These warriors, called guardians, train daily with their comrades learning to fight as a unit in close formation. Chapters outfit their guardians with weapons and armour and most provide a surcoat adorned with the chapter?s heraldic device, usually in black and white or similarly contrasting colours. Some groups of guardians choose to specialise, training to become cataphracts or unconquered, in line with the oldest martial traditions of the Highborn.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cataphracts">Cataphracts</span></h2>
<p>In the earliest days of Highguard, the cataphracts rode into battle on mighty war horses, devastating their enemies with shield and lance. Today the horses are gone, but the cataphracts remain, embodying a warrior tradition that embraces the highest virtues of the Imperial Faith. Heavily armoured, they serve as living standards, encouraging and supporting those who fight alongside them with their commitment to achieving victory. The best of them burn with fervour, filling them with righteous fury when they face the enemies of the Empire in close combat. Likewise, when an army must fall back, it is the cataphracts who guard the retreat.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Unconquered">Unconquered</span></h2>
<p>The counterpart to the cataphracts are the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Unconquered" title="Unconquered">unconquered</a>. These skilled warriors undertake scouting missions, employ sabotage and terror as weapons to weaken their foes, and seek out specific targets on a battlefield. In contrast to the archers and skirmishers of many other nations, the unconquered favour medium armour and short bows, and are not shy about engaging in close combat with hand weapons if the tides of battle make retreat-and-fire an unappealing option.
</p>
<div class="captioned-image captioned-image-right"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:BurntForehead.jpg" class="image"><img alt="BurntForehead.jpg" src="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/dd/BurntForehead.jpg/270px-BurntForehead.jpg" width="270" height="405" srcset="/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/dd/BurntForehead.jpg/405px-BurntForehead.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/dd/BurntForehead.jpg/540px-BurntForehead.jpg 2x" /></a><div class="caption"></div></div>
<p>The unconquered are used to operating with a high level of autonomy, often behind enemy lines or in unknown territory. Despite this independence, the best of them know that they operate as one part of a larger plan, that their duty is to ensure that the forces they accompany achieve victory. Unconquered who arrogantly assume they can win the day all by themselves generally meet unpleasant ends.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Vigilant_War">The Vigilant War</span></h2>
<p>Highborn generals and soldiers alike embrace the concept of a vigilant war. This principle teaches that strong defences and preemptive strikes are the most effective way to curtail an enemy?s ability to be an aggressor, minimising the impact on civilians, and making it the most practical and moral solution to the matter of war. On the battlefield their troops work together to utterly overwhelm their enemies as quickly as possible, cataphracts driving them from the field while the unconquered deny them any chance to regroup and counter-attack.

<p>The venerable Thundering Tide was composed of the descendants of the old Highborn light cavalry units.

<p>Bastion is the birthplace of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way" title="The Way">the Way of Virtue</a> and the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Synod" title="The Synod" class="mw-redirect">Imperial Synod</a> was founded here. In the days before the Empire was founded, <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapters" title="Chapters" class="mw-redirect">chapters</a> like the Winds of Virtue sought to take The Way to other nations. This in turn led many pilgrims to travel to Highguard seeking to experience their past lives. During the early decades of the Empire a constant influx of visitors came to the great city, many of whom engaged in discussion with the Highborn priests and each other before carrying the seeds of the Way of Virtue back to their own nations.
</p><p>Highborn priests are dedicated to the Way of Virtue, and in ensuring that it does not become corrupted by outside forces. Through virtue, the Empress was able to forge a union of the disparate human nations. It is that same virtue that keeps the Empire strong to this day. Highborn priests at home, in the Synod and throughout the Empire continue to preach the Orthodox Imperial Creed, ever vigilant for heresy that might undermine it.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wayfarers">Wayfarers</span></h3>
<p>Highborn priests know that the strength of the Empire is intimately bound to the Imperial Faith. This has lead to the tradition of the Wayfarers - priests who act like missionaries, travelling the Empire to encourage the people to actively embrace not only the Imperial Faith but the ideals of the Empire itself. They often make a close study of the people they move amongst, reminding them of their own heroes and virtuous exemplars.
</p><p>Warfarers tend to wear a wide sash of braided black and white cloth as a symbol of their office. It is usually worn over a traditional Highborn robe with a heavy cowl or veil. They try to help people make up their own minds and come to their own conclusions, through careful questioning and encouragement to examine motivations, actions and beliefs.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Inquisition">The Inquisition</span></h3>
<p>Highborn history teaches the dangers inherent in the senate system. When the Patrician Council turned from serving the good of the nation and became self-serving, it nearly destroyed Highguard. Ever mindful of the dangers, Highborn priests are vigilant for treason, hypocrisy and corruption. They watch the Imperial Senate for warning signs that it has become corrupted, and are prepared to take action to ensure it remains the servant of the Empire and not its master. They also look closely at outside influences ? foreigners, Eternals, so-called ?free thinkers? and the like. 
</p><p>The Highborn know how important it is to preserve the purity of the Imperial Faith, and the Empire as a whole. Highborn priests ensure that the Imperial Synod retains the powers of Inquisition and Revocation, and actively use those powers to ensure the Empire thrives. Priests who embrace an inquisitorial role often use the image of the Basilisk Awake ? a lizard with terrible red eyes that legend says can strike the unworthy dead with is piercing gaze.
</p><p>The Synod has occasionally debated requesting the Senate authorize the formalization of an official Imperial Inquisition, to give it additional binding powers. Support for this is mixed; some priests argue that enhanced powers would make the Inquisition more effective, others argue that the duty of vigilance and inquisition is one that all priests should exercise - that it should not be restricted to members of a separate body. All attempts to create a formal body have foundered in the past - instead there have been countless unofficial groups, often acting in secret, who have dedicated themselves to the spirit of Inquisition, looking to root out heresy and those guilty of less-than-virtuous behaviour.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stewards_of_the_dead">Stewards of the dead</span></h3>
<p>Some priests become stewards of the dead. Dedicated to recording the deeds of heroes of the Empire, they maintain the tombs and mausoleums of the Necropolis. Their calling means they do more than simply tend graves ? they collect stories and histories of the dead, and use these stories as a method to encourage and inspire the living. They officiate at funerals in Highguard, generally an entombment of the body, but regardless of whether mortal remains are involved every Highborn wants their name inscribed on a monument in the Necropolis.
</p><p>By tradition, every dead Emperor and Empress should be entombed in the Necropolis, and the stewards take this responsibility very seriously. They also ?collect? the bodies of heroes of other Nations, and offer to inter them in the Necropolis which serves as a reminder of the deeds of heroes. 
</p><p>It is also the role of the stewards to deal with the excursions of dead spirits. Usually this takes the form of a shade or spirit with pressing business that reaches out towards its living relatives in a terrifying manner. The stewards are charged with interceding and laying the spirit to rest. At the same time they work with the Magi to ensure that the occasional ambulatory corpses that appear in the necropolis are dealt with respectfully but effectively.
</p><p>The stewards generally dress in simple robes in the style of whichever chapter they belong to. They often carry a book to record the deeds of heroes, and at festivals recite tales to bring to life the memory of those who have gone before. They ring bells and speak to the accompaniment of wind-chimes, allowing the breath of the dead to add their own contribution to the tales of their deeds.

<p>Priests who work to master magic are called <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Magisters" title="Magisters" class="mw-redirect">magisters</a> in Highguard. The early magisters studied methods of communicating with the dead and uncovering the secrets of the past. The Highborn Magisters strive to be the foremost masters of Winter magic in the Empire. Most operate out of hostels based in the Necropolis, where the silence and contemplative atmosphere of the city of the dead lends itself perfectly to measured and contemplative study.
</p><p>While there is no doubt they possess powerful magic, the magisters are still considered to be priests. They study virtue alongside magic, and many work hard to try and inspire virtuous behaviour in wizards of other nations ? or an understanding of magic in other priests.
</p><p>Magisters tend to be cautious of the Eternals, as they are not only powerful, but they clearly seek to use that power to influence humanity. The Highborn believe that as masters of their own destiny, humans should seek to outwit Eternals wherever possible, seizing opportunities to take their strength and harness it in service to the Empire. Eternals are clearly monstrous and inhuman. It is a source of continual frustration to the magisters that other wizards fail to recognise this, no matter how seriously the magisters try to educate them in their dealings with other realms. The magisters treat most often, and most comfortably, with the Eternals of Winter, who they see as more open and honest, as they do not try to deny or conceal their evil nature. The Eternals of the other realms are equally dangerous, but present a pleasing and deceptive face, which many accept without scrutiny.
</p><p>The magical tradition of Highguard combines movement and sound. The slow beating of drums, the sonorous chime of bells and the recitation of ceremonial passages form the basis of their ritual magic, often accompanied by stylised and graceful gestures.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bells_and_chimes">Bells and chimes</span></h2>
<p>The Highborn hang wind-chimes in their doorways to bring back memories of those they have lost, and the echoes of wisdom from earlier days. Meditating to the sound of wind chimes is said to help to attune one to thoughts of one?s ancestors and prior incarnations, and allow the dead to ?speak? to the living through their memories. The household use of bells endures for similar reason, in the belief that the wind carries the breath and words of the departed. It is commonly held that bells can speak for those who have no breath or voice. The sound of bells ringing encourages the Highborn to remember the words of dead people who are important or inspirational to them.
</p><p>More practically, bells and chimes exert influence over the unquiet dead. Restless spirits will not approach the sound of wind chimes, and the ringing of bells causes such creatures to flee in terror. As a consequence, most people who spend any time around the dead - especially the stewards of the dead and magisters - will keep a bell on their person at all times.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cowls_and_Veils">Cowls and Veils</span></h2>
<p>Properly prepared and worn head coverings conceal the identity of the wearer. Unlike the masks of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League" title="The League">the League</a>, they do not present a false-face to the world; this is a hearth magic of obfuscation, not deception. The wearer maintains their sense of self, but they present a blank exterior to outsiders, an enigma. They step away from the world for a short time and become apart from it - a tradition that leads to many Highborn circles ceremonially donning cowls or veils when they must talk of matters of justice, or frankly discuss sensitive matters. The wearer of the cowl or veil metaphorically ceases to be themselves for the duration of such a discussion. 
</p><p>When the Highborn don veils or draw up their cowls as a group, it means they are about serious business. For some, it means they have stopped being individual humans and for a short time embody primal forces of virtue.
</p><p>This concealment can grant supernatural protection; creatures of the realms often find it hard to identify whom they are speaking to when dealing with people who have ceremonially concealed their features with a cowl or veil.

<p>In the same way that material things can become dirty, or worn, or tainted, so the soul can become corrupt. Purification removes taint and cleanses material goods and the soul alike. Tainted, corrupted things are less effective - a sword caked with mud and grime is not as sharp as a clean sword well maintained. Worse, corruption (like virtue) can be contagious. Soiled hands soil whatever they touch. Water and fire are both used to purify and clean - metal objects in particular can be purified with an open flame.

Someone who feels they have acted unvirtuously may symbolically wash themselves before beginning to make amends for their behaviour. There have been accusations that zealous Highborn have executed people they considered particularly unvirtuous with immolation or drowning, but there is no evidence of this. Indeed, many Highborn would find the idea of doing so abhorrent and showing a fundamental lack of understanding of the difference between the body and the spirit. -->

<p>Highguard is not a generous nation to the less than fully human. In the crudest and simplest of terms, they are perceived as being spiritually suspect. While it is undeniable that they embrace the virtues with great passion, they must continually resist the siren call of their blood, or risk corruption by their lineage. As a result those with lineage are watched until they have proved themselves. Even then, many Highborn still regard them with suspicion for fear that they may eventually succumb.

<p>Orcs and other non-humans are judged more harshly than the lineaged. Their inability to use liao casts doubt over their ability to reincarnate, and so it is considered impossible for them to meaningfully embrace the Imperial Faith. This makes them less than human in the eyes of many Highborn.
</p><p>The issue of Imperial Orcs is a thorny one in Highguard. The Highborn Senators were united in opposing the admittance of orcs into the Empire, and called on the Synod to veto the move when they were defeated in the Senate. Today, some Highborn are inclined to treat them charitably for making the effort to be civilised, whilst others maintain a traditional attitude of contempt and hostility. Very few have any enthusiasm for seeing the orcs gain further power and influence within the Empire. As long as the orcs are seen to embrace Imperial values, there is little their Highborn critics can do beyond providing the voice of caution. It seems inevitable that in the end, the orcs will undermine the strength of the Empire either as part of a long-term treachery, or simply by diluting the traditions which have formed and sustained its greatness.

That peace is fragile, however - the vallorn of neighbouring <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande" title="Brocliande">Brocliande</a> stirs in its slumber, and the recent occupation of Reikos by the Druj sent a stark message of the dangers of complacency. The wealth of Casinea lies in its hills and their rich mines and quarries, and in the timber and rare materials found in its western forests.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Necropolis"><a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis" title="Necropolis">Necropolis</a></span></h2>
<p>The first Highborn settled along the coast of the Bay of Catazar here, driving out the orcs to conquer the territory. They called the territory Pharos, and built a great city here to serve as their capital. That city burnt to the ground during the civil war, and was then rebuilt as a memorial to all that had been lost. Today, the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#The_Necropolis" title="Necropolis">great cemetery</a> holds the mortal remains of some of the greatest Imperial citizens who ever lived - the heroes and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Throne" title="The Throne">Thrones</a> who built the Empire and continue to defend it.
</p><p>Necropolis is a land of sorrow, first and foremost. Poets wax lyrical about the sad grandeur of the landscape, but even the least sensitive sometimes have to suppress a shiver at the realisation of their own mortality. Yet the sorrow of Necropolis is tempered with the knowledge that all things pass - that sorrows teach valuable lessons, and that loss is part of life. Even the most bustling chapterhouse in Necropolis will contain some memento mori, some little touch that is ignored consciously but that subconsciously reminds them every day that people die.

<p>This formerly peaceful stretch of the Couros river was once known for its pleasant gardens, gentle parks, and beautiful countryside. It became wealthy thanks to the bounty of stone and wood from the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilant_Swan" title="Vigilant Swan">Vigilant Swan</a> and the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_Forest_at_Reikos" title="Great Forest at Reikos">Great Forest</a>; herbs from the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Gardens_of_High_Chalcis" title="Gardens of High Chalcis">Gardens of High Chalcis</a>; trade with <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Therunin" title="Therunin">Therunin</a> and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow" title="Morrow">Morrow</a>; and from the beauty that made it a favourite place for Imperial citizens from across the Empire to convalesce after illness, or to spend time away for the cares of everyday life. Then the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj" title="Druj">Druj</a> came, and after them the merciless rejuvenating power of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eternals" title="Eternals">eternal</a> <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Llofir" title="Llofir">Llofir</a>, and the face of Reikos was changed perhaps forever.
</p><p>Today Reikos is in flux. The chapters that fled are returning, those that weathered the storm are rebuilding. The parks and gardens are gone, overwritten with new forest or drowned in blood during the war and subsequent liberation. A malign <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj_miasma" title="Druj miasma">miasma</a> still clings to the hidden places where the Druj performed their abominable rites, while the desperate spirits of those who fell to their blades continue to haunt the living. Perhaps the beauty of Reikos may be restored, tempered by the knowledge of how fragile it is. Perhaps the new Reikos will be a darker place forged in bitterness and loss.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Highborn_Territories_in_Play">Highborn Territories in Play</span></h2>
<p>Every Highborn <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapter" title="Chapter">chapter</a> is located in a single territory. During character creation, you select your <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Territory#Home_Territory" title="Territory">home territory</a> - the territory where your <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Resource#Personal_Resource" title="Resource">personal resource</a> is located - and under normal circumstances this would be the territory where your chapter is based.
</p><p>Highguard elections are only partially based on considerations of territory. The <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator" title="Senator">senator</a> for each territory is<a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_leadership#Leading_a_territory" title="Highguard leadership">decided</a> by the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Assembly#The_National_Assemblies" title="Assembly">National Assembly</a> - every Highborn character with a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Congregation" title="Congregation">congregation</a> can take part regardless of their home territory - but the actual candidates are put forward by the chapters based in the territory that is being elected. As a result <i>where you are from</i> can still effect your ability to take part in politics.
</p><p>You don't need to declare which <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Territory#Regions" title="Territory">region</a> you live in, but it's often useful for your group to define the location of your chapterhouse for purposes of plot, and for making the game world feel more real. You might live in or near one of the established settlements, but your chapterhouse could be built anywhere in the territory - the named villages and towns  are by no means the only settlements in Highguard! Your character background, or your group background, can include a few details about your home if you like, and many chapterhouses come with their own small settlement that looks to them for protection and guidance.
</p><p>Each of the four territories has certain themes, which are often used as a starting point when plot writers create plot. Furthermore, certain personal resources lend themselves to certain territories better than others. These are suggestions, however, rather than hard and fast rules. In particular, the personal resources of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Congregation" title="Congregation">congregation</a> and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Military_unit" title="Military unit">military unit</a> are appropriate to any of the four Highborn territories - although it's still a good idea to flavour your resource to reflect the individual character of your home territory.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Being_from_Bastion">Being from Bastion</span></h3>
<p>Bastion is the heart of Highguard, and has themes of <b>faith</b> and <b>destiny</b>. The most important settlement is without doubt the city that shares its name with the territory - the White City of Bastion. There is something of an echo of the real-world Vatican about the White City - it is the centre of a world-wide faith after all. It's also a politically charged place - the Highborn see themselves as the shepherds of human destiny, but not everyone agrees as to where that destiny might lead.
</p><p>Outside the city, this is a very civilised territory. It is widely settled, and even its woodlands tend to be reasonably safe. Bastion is not much troubled by bandits or monsters, for example. The key conflicts in Bastion are likely to come through disagreements with fellow Highborn, or with people of other nations who question the assumption that Highguard should guide the future of the Empire.
</p><p>Bastion is a good place to be from if you intend to be involved in the politics of Highguard, regardless of your personal resource. The White City is full of priests, and makes an excellent place to maintain a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Congregation" title="Congregation">congregation</a>, while the chapters along the border with Reikos have had a lot of recent experience fighting the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj" title="Druj">Druj</a> and might lend themselves to an interesting background for a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Military_unit" title="Military unit">military unit</a>. <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm" title="Farm">Farms</a> and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Business" title="Business">businesses</a> alike make sense here, and the carefully cultivated woodlands would be an excellent site for a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a> resource.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Being_from_Casinea">Being from Casinea</span></h3>
<p>Casinea has themes of <b>tradition</b> and the <b>vigilance</b> required to protect those traditions. The most important settlement in Casinea is without doubt Anvil - the political heart of the entire Empire - which contributes to the undercurrents of conflict and suspicion in the territory. It is easy for visitors to forget that Anvil is by no means a truly Highborn settlement - and several of the chapters here look askance at the unvirtuous behaviour that takes place there during the seasonal Summits. There are deep divisions beneath the surface of Casinea - between the prosperous chapters of the east and the insular chapters of the west, as well as between the traditional, insular chapters and those who embrace the benefits of being part of the larger Empire. Historically, Casinea is where the Highborn fought other humans - the people of Dawn, the Navarr, even the Marchers on occasion.
</p><p>Casinea is a good choice for chapters that are interested in sources of raw materials - especially <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine" title="Mine">mines</a> but also <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forests</a>. This is also a territory with a long history of trading with other nations. With the proximity of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League" title="The League">the League</a>, the regular influx of traders and travellers heading to <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Anvil" title="Casinea">Anvil</a>, and the completion of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/index.php?title=Blood_Red_Roads&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Blood Red Roads (page does not exist)">Blood Red Roads</a> it makes an excellent choice for a character or chapter interested in <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Business" title="Business">business</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Being_from_Necropolis">Being from Necropolis</span></h3>
<p>Necropolis has themes of <b>sorrow</b> and also <b>mystery</b>. The Necropolis itself is the heart of the territory, and a reminder of the dangers of a lack of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance" title="Vigilance">Vigilance</a> can lead to. After all, the Necropolis was once Pharos - the capital of the Highborn - until it was destroyed by a civil war that grew out of corruption, indolence, and arrogance. The barriers between the living and the dead are thin here, and this means that of all the Highborn territories it is perhaps the most magical in nature. It's also where the Highborn first settled, and is steeped in history - a character who wants to explore the complex relationship between Highborn history and truth could find an appropriate home here.
</p><p>The territory is sparsely settled, and has a slightly exaggerated reputation for being full of ghosts. The Necropolis itself is strongly associated with the study of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Winter_magic" title="Winter magic">Winter magic</a>, and this is an excellent territory for a chapter that is interested in magic to be based. A <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Magister" title="Magister">magister</a> will be right at home here, and there is plenty of space to maintain <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mana_site" title="Mana site">mana sites</a>. As with Bastion it is also a good choice for a <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Congregation" title="Congregation">congregation</a>. In the case of Necropolis, however, the priests have a tendency to be more practical than political in nature - their congregations are more important for allowing them access to the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liao" title="Liao">liao</a> they need to practice their <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Religious_skills" title="Religious skills">ceremonies</a> than for the votes they provide in the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod" title="Imperial Synod">Imperial Synod</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Being_from_Reikos">Being from Reikos</span></h3>
<p>Reikos is about <b>loss</b> and <b>new beginnings</b>. The largest remaining settlement in Reikos is High Chalcis, but it is a shadow of its former self. For fourteen years, it was occupied by the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj" title="Druj">Druj</a> orcs - orcs known for their cruelty. The people were mercilessly dominated, enslaved, forced to work until they dropped, and slaughtered if they showed the slightest sign of rebellion. Hundreds were killed as an example, or a threat, or on a whim. The territory itself was ravaged from one end to another, ruined, and rebuilt in as a corrupt mirror of what it had once been. After the liberation, the signs of the occupation were washed away by the tide of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/A_season_of_mushrooms" title="A season of mushrooms">Llofir's magic</a>, but the scars on the souls and memories of those who experienced them first hand will not be healed so easily.
</p><p>Without a doubt, Reikos is the best for for a chapter or individual interested in herbs and <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Herb_garden" title="Herb garden">herb gardens</a>. The presence of the <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Gardens_of_High_Chalcis" title="Gardens of High Chalcis">Gardens of High Chalcis</a> gives an immediate benefit to anyone who maintains a herb garden. Thematically Reikos was not only a place of healing but was occupied by the Druj - experts in herb lore. it is also a particularly good fit for a martial chapter - the triple threats of the Forest of Peytaht, the vallorn of Brocliande, and the presence of Llofir in Tamarbode are all good reasons for the captains of <a href="https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Military_unit" title="Military unit">military units</a> to take an interest in Reikos.

<p>Highguard is not a populous nation and every child is considered a precious blessing. Although children are forbidden by Imperial law to use liao before they come of age, they are expected to study and embody the virtues from a young age. As heirs to the great heritage of the Highborn, children are encouraged to push themselves to live up to the heroes of the past.
</p><p>Children are encouraged to question what they see and experience, especially where the Virtues are concerned. They are encouraged to talk about the things they have seen with their parents, especially the actions of others which they could not see the Virtue in. This allows them to gain a better understanding of the Virtues by asking their parents to explain how they apply in everyday life, as well as helping their parents to be vigilant against any corruption in their children's lives.
</p><p>Children who have a solid grounding in the Way are often given a purple ribbon or seven pointed star by the priests, so that they can help other children learn about the Virtues.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Style_summary">Style summary</span></h3>
<p>Highguard's music draws its inspiration from Western church choral music, plainsong and shapenote music (also known as Sacred Harp). Of these, the last probably best exemplifies the musical style - Highguard music is robust and enthusiastic, and accessible to all levels of talent. They enjoy rich harmonies and proudly devotional texts, although amongst themselves a wicked sense of humour occasionally emerges in some soldiers' songs and there are also some surprisingly tender lullabies.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="A_musical_tradition">A musical tradition</span></h4>
<p>The Highguard Battle Choirs are a great imperial tradition - no nation matches to battle with the same holy fervour in their singing. Usually accompanied by a single drumbeat, the sound of the Highguard army in full voice is an awe-inspiring and intimidating sound. Often a small number of more confident singers lead the chant in a call-and-response pattern. At least in this context the choirsters are warriors first and musicians second - the singers need not be particularly talented, as it is holy fervour and their indomitable will that characterises the battle choir.

An example is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xti9lXz3lVI" rel="nofollow" class="external text">Circle March (arranged by Katy Cooper)<i class="icon-share-alt"></i></a> which starts in unison then goes into 4ths before full harmony.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Look_and_feel">Look and feel</span></h2>
<p>The Highborn look is generally practical and restrained. Its beauty is in both the small touches ? the geometric trim on the robes, the exquisite jewellery. Colours are deliberately stark and contrasting, and outfits in black and white are commonplace. Many members of a chapter choose to adopt similar garb, with the symbol of their chapter displayed prominently on the chest, shoulders, or at the breast. This is particularly true for Highborn warriors who show their solidarity and loyalty with their fellows by marching into battle decked in identical garb. Of all the nations of the Empire, the Highborn are the most inclined to uniformity, a visible display of their inner commitment to their shared faith and destiny. 
</p><p>Rather than displaying impractical frivolity in the cut of their garments, Highborn show their taste and wealth in jewellery, and the decoration of cloth. Jewelled and embellished trims at the hems of garments are popular, as is the intricate braiding of hair and heavy, elaborate jewellery.
</p><p>Highguard is one of the nations with the least historical inspiration. It draws its influence heavily from classic fantasy such as Lord of the Rings, with a real emphasis on the Numenorian and Gondorian styles brought to life in the Peter Jackson trilogy. The look is strong and stark, and what makes it relatively easy to create a strong and distinctive look is the colour scheme - almost any western European medieval look in black, white and a touch of jewel toned colour will look excellent.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dawn">Dawn</span></h3>
<p>Highguard probably has most in common with Dawnish costume - the love of rich, lavish fabrics, elegant in cut but with elaborate trim and jewellery is a feature they share. However, Dawnish costume should be a vivid pageant of colour; by contrast, Highguard clothing should be high contrast, mostly in black and white, with a hint of jewel-toned colour. Veils and cowls help to keep the look distinct.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marches">Marches</span></h3>
<p>Monks in the marches will wear similar robes to those in Highguard. Sticking to black or white, and adding geometric trim around your robes, possibly with the addition of a mitre-like hat for high status priest looks very Highborn.

<p>An excellent source of information on making fantasy costumes inspired by Lord of the Rings is <a href="http://www.alleycatscratch.com" rel="nofollow" class="external text">Alley Cat Scratch<i class="icon-share-alt"></i></a>. It covers everything from garment patterns, metalwork and sourcing trim. Re-enactment sources referenced on the Marches, Dawn and Wintermark pages are all good for inspiration - the colour palette, more than the shape of the garment, gives the uniform look to the nation.

<p>A rather severe look - black velvet or brocade works beautifully in contrast with silver fasteners or buttons. For any gender, a close fitting gown looks suitably Highborn, referencing without overtly stating their faithfulness.

<p>A gown is a reasonably close fitting robe, usually buttoning down the front, with long close fitting sleeves to the wrist. It persists to this day as the cassock and in the clothes of choirsters and some very traditional public school uniforms, all of which means both patterns and off-the-peg versions are fairly readily available.

<p>It's a very adaptable look - a fantasy treatment could take the basic silhouette and standing collar, and shorten the overall length, either with full length or half length sleeves, as worn by Boromir, Uther Pendragon and Jamie Lannister for a "warrior's coat". It looks good worn open over chainmail. A close-fitting variant of this is the cotehardie which usually has lots of closely spaced buttons down the front and the sleeves - try googling "cotehardie". It can be a tough look to pull off, but well worth it!

<p>Priests who choose not to dress like Templars (below) might draw inspiration from the images above. Based on the Eastern Orthodox tradition, these priests have layered robes with decorated over-garments, perhaps with a mitre-type hat or a padded roll on their head. A how-to for a basic robe, tabard and hood is linked below. Over the top, you could make a "stole", which is essentially a long scarf worn around the neck and falling past the waist - trimmed with an ornate ribbon trim this would look very dramatic. Try searching for ecclesiastical trim on ebay - there is a huge variety available relatively cheaply. You could also make a tabard or circular cape and trim it in matching colours.

<p>An alternative look, ideally suited to the Keepers of the Dead, is a more monk-like costume. This is made up of similar layers - an ankle-length robe, with or without a simple over-tabard and with a hood or cowl. The robe can be worn loose or belted with a cord or narrow braid of cloth for convenience and ease of movement. Coarse, heavy fabrics such as linen, silk noil and wool work well for this look, in dark grey or black. To make it slightly more fancy (and avoid confusion with the marches) you could trim the edges with a contrasting geometric trim (perhaps a greek key or swirl) such as those available from  <a href="http://stores.ebay.co.uk/GRANDBAZAAR24/JACQUARD-RIBBON-/_i.html?_fsub=2" rel="nofollow" class="external text">this ebay seller<i class="icon-share-alt"></i></a> or similar.

<p>The key to the uniform Templar look is a surcote or tabard in their chapter colours with a design on it. While lightweight fabrics such as polycotton are cheap and easy to work with, if your budget allows, consider using a heavier cotton, linen or silk, with or without lining, as these materials drape better, look better and wear better. That said, a unit in matching surcotes, even lightweight ones, looks fabulous, so don't worry too much about your materials.
</p><p>If you have fabric left over, consider making a circular or semicircular cloak to match, perhaps with your chapter symbol on the breast or on the back.

<p>The base layer for the Unconquered is a knee-length tunic, either without armour or with lighter armour worn over it. A palette of neutral forest colours helps them scout and remain unseen when in the field, so choosing browns, greens and greys is in keeping with this. Less elaborate than many other Highguard costume, there is still a role for contrasting trim, particularly if the character is wearing their "special occasions" clothes. Adding a fur or fake fur mantle might add to the look - a cheap and cruelty-free way of adding fur trim to your costume is to get old fur coats from charity shops and cut them down - sometimes they also have 1940s style capelets which need very little alteration to be used as a shoulder piece.

<p>At its simplest, a cowl is a cylinder of fabric that sits around your shoulders and over your head. Choosing a soft, drapey fabric like muslin will help it sit properly. A 1 yard piece of muslin or silk habutai that's 45 inches wide, seamed down its length and hemmed at either raw end will make a very full, drapy cowl. For the "monk" or "Keeper of the Dead" look above, use a yard of fabric that matches the rest of your robes.

<p>Again best made using a very soft, drapy fabric like muslin, a veil is a circular, oval or rectangular piece of fabric to sit on your head. The Freeborn use veils to cover the lower half of their face; the Highborn look is far more concealing and drapes over the entire head, usually held in place by a circlet, crown or ribbon band. Don't skimp on the fabric - muslin is very cheap and a 2 or 3m length will give a sumptuous look to your veil. Consider edging it in lightweight trim for a finished look, or round the corners and turn a narrow hem.
If you wear it just by putting it on your head then holding it on with a circlet, over time the veil will shift and ride up, leading to the dread "muffin head" look. For comfort and style, you might want to consider pinning it to a ribbon tied around your head, or utilising the methods in <a href="http://www.virtue.to/articles/veils.html" rel="nofollow" class="external text">this tutorial<i class="icon-share-alt"></i></a>, though bear in mind that for the SCA they wear the veil in a more historical fashion to cover the hair, rather than to sit over the face.
</p><p>To uncover your face while wearing a veil the Highborn way, flip it back over the crown or band holding it in place, like a bride's veil, without taking it off your head. It's then ready to flip forward and cover your face again whenever you want.

<p>A cloak is a near-essential part of your costume, and a great opportunity to give your kit a finishing touch and keep you cosy. For light fabrics such as muslin, you can make a gathered-neck cloak with a drawstring for ease of construction- with heavy wools and velvet, a semicircular or circular mantle works best to reduce bulk at the neck and drapes beautifully. For a priest's mantle, a semi-circle or 3/4 circle cloak works best.

<p>Any refined and elegant jewellery works in Highguard, best in matching sets to tone with the costume. Particular emphasis is on crowns and circlets. Lord of the Rings replica jewellery is an expensive but very beautiful way of getting the look, but there are numerous "inspired by" items, often on ebay, and several excellent tutorials on how to make your own out of wire, clay and beads.
