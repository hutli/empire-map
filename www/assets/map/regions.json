Summer is short, but Winter is long, and haunted by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Northern_lights\" title=\"Sermersuaq\">eerie lights</a> in the sky. Gildenheim in the east was once the second largest settlement in Wintermark. The territory was once an important part of Wintermark; the folk of Skarsind were particularly noted for their fine rune work and many of the best <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Crafting_skills#Artisan\" title=\"Crafting skills\">artisans</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_magical_traditions#Runesmiths\" title=\"Wintermark magical traditions\">runesmiths</a> travelled here to study their craft.</p><p>Now, the people of Skarsind are the Imperial Orcs. There are still some Winterfolk here, but since the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Falcon_in_winter\" title=\"Falcon in winter\">rise</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Wolf_in_the_Fold_.28Skarsind.29\" title=\"381YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">fall</a> of the Wintermark rebel Dogri Thulebane, the number of humans living in the hills and forests of Skarsind has tailed away to little more than a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Skarsind_Game_Information\" title=\"381YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">scattered handful</a>. The Imperial Orcs do nothing to make them unwelcome, but for many there is simply nothing left for them in Skarsind.

The largest settlement - <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Gildenheim\">Gildenheim</a> - stands over the entrance to a frozen underworld cavern into the walls of which are carvings in a mysterious alphabet that are widely believed to be the source of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Runes\" title=\"Runes\">magical runes</a> used throughout Wintermark.

The blizzard served as magical cover for an army of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> barbarians who marched beneath it, using powerful Winter rituals to reinforce their armies with hordes of walking corpses created from battlefield dead. They attacked <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Gildenheim\">Gildenheim</a> with the assistance of a dozen enslaved <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_Magical_Traditions#Artok\" title=\"Wintermark Magical Traditions\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Artok</a>, smashing great holes in the defences. Some small pockets of resistance remained - mostly based around the mines and halls to the north-east - but the situation looked increasingly desperate until 377YE, when Imperial forces were able to push into Skarsind and drive the Thule forces out of the territory and reclaim it for the Empire.</p><p>At the beginning of 379YE, the Wintermark people took the historic decision to bequeath the land to the Imperial Orcs. A <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Relinquish_Skarsind\" title=\"Relinquish Skarsind\">motion</a> was brought before the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> to relinquish Skarsind so that it could be reassigned to the Imperial Orcs. The motion passed the Senate but could not be put into force without <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Throne#Ratification\" title=\"The Throne\">ratification</a> by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Throne\" title=\"The Throne\">The Throne</a>. This hurdle too was crossed when the Imperial Orcs acquired the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Throne#Imperial_Favour\" title=\"The Throne\">Imperial favour</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Britta\" title=\"Empress Britta\">Empress Britta</a> which granted the holder the ability to ratify a decision of the Imperial Senate. At that point Skarsind became an Imperial Orc territory.</p><p>The move was not without its critics however; not only would the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Brilliant_Shore\" title=\"Brilliant Shore\">Brilliant Shore</a> cease to be a Wintermark <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Bourse\" title=\"Imperial Bourse\">Bourse seat</a>, but the Winterfolk residents of Skarsind would almost certainly need to relocate to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark\" title=\"Hahnmark\">hahnmark</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesa\" title=\"Kallavesa\">Kallavesa</a>, or <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq\" title=\"Sermersuaq\">Sermersuaq</a>. There were even some Orcs who disagreed with the decision (perhaps unwilling to see the people of Skarsind made homeless on their behalf).</p><p>Many existing residents of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Territory\" title=\"Territory\">territory</a> resisted the urge to give up their ancestral homeland. Their protest found leadership under the influence of a charismatic Thane, Dogri Thulesbane, a Wintermark hero who had fought the Thule all his life. Dogri <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Falcon_in_winter\" title=\"Falcon in winter\">claimed</a> the old, isolated fort of Crow's Keep in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Crow.E2.80.99s_Ridge\" title=\"Skarsind\">the north</a>, an ideal position from which to watch both <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Otkodov\" title=\"Otkodov\">Otkodov</a> and the Thule-dominated mountains of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Silver_Peaks\" title=\"Sermersuaq\">Silver Peaks</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq\" title=\"Sermersuaq\">Sermersuaq</a>. After a year of arguments, the Empire were forced to act on news that Dogri <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_widening_gyre\" title=\"The widening gyre\">planned to raise an army</a> to take the fight to the Thule in breach of the existing <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Accept_Thule_peace_treaty\" title=\"Accept Thule peace treaty\">peace treaty</a>.

The Thulebane was taked to Anvil where he was tried and ultimately executed. His death broke the spirit of those Wintermarkers who had hoped to hang on in Skarsind and most left soon after.</p><p>Not all is doom and gloom, however. Skarsind has seen a wave of rebuilding and improvements since the Imperial Orcs took custody in 379YE.

Founded by Gilda Heimssdottir, it stands over the entrance to a frozen underworld cavern into the walls of which are carvings in a mysterious alphabet that are said to be the source of the magical runes used throughout Wintermark and the wider Empire. It fell to the barbarians in 373YE after a long siege. Inge Suvvisdottir, most recent of the bearers of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_history\" title=\"Wintermark history\">crown of Wintermark</a>, fell with it; the crown was lost when she fell and would not be recovered for many years. Despite the demands of Wintermark senators for resolute and overwhelming response, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Walter\" title=\"Emperor Walter\">Emperor Walter</a> dithered and did nothing to support the defence.</p><p>The Imperial Orcs have largely completed the work begun by the Winterfolk after the liberation, and the town again serves as a focal point for the territory. A number of civil servants are permanently posted here explicitly to help immigrant orcs settle into their new homes and emigrant Winterfolk to transition peacefully to the west, and there are extensive barracks and training grounds for use by the Imperial Orcs armies.</p><p>In the Autumn of 379YE, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marcher</a> by the name of Peter of Hintown <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forge_of_sorrows\" title=\"Forge of sorrows\">discovered by chance</a> what appears to be an ancient, collapsed <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Runeforge\" title=\"Runeforge\">Runeforge</a> under Gildenheim.

A <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Historical_research\" title=\"Historical research\">historical research</a> project was commissioned in Autumn 379YE to explore the so-called <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Gildenheim_runeforge\" title=\"Gildenheim runeforge\">Gildenheim runeforge</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legion.27s_Rookery\">Legion's Rookery</span></h3><p>One of the few structures left standing in Gildenheim after the Thule invasion was the Hall of the White Ravens. Many survivors saw this white granite hall as a symbol that Gildenheim could rise from the ashes, and reach even greater heights than before, but those dreams were abandoned when Skarsind was passed to the Imperial Orcs. In 381YE the Imperial Synod recognized the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Doctrines_of_the_Faith\" title=\"The Doctrines of the Faith\">Doctrines</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Doctrines_of_the_Faith#The_Doctrine_of_the_Howling_Abyss\" title=\"The Doctrines of the Faith\">the Howling Abyss</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Doctrines_of_the_Faith#The_Doctrine_of_the_Ancestors\" title=\"The Doctrines of the Faith\">the Ancestors</a> which clarified and strengthened the place of those orc pilgrims who embraced the Way. As the implications of the changes to doctrine became clear, several well respected <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Preachers\" title=\"Preachers\">preachers</a> called for a permanent site to serve as a focus for the faithful and to celebrate their newly defined status. </p><p>The Hall of White Ravens - by then the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Congregation\" title=\"Congregation\">congregation</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Cardinal\" title=\"Cardinal\">Cardinal</a> Atla of the Assembly of the Way - was the obvious candidate to provide such a focus. The Hall was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Construct_The_Legion%27s_Rookery\" title=\"Construct The Legion's Rookery\">converted</a> into the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Legion.27s_Rookery\">Legion's Rookery</a>, a great hall that could serve as a spiritual center for the Imperial Orcs to explore their understanding of The Way.

Several of the white granite ravens that once adorned the front of the original structure were recovered and restored, and complemented by several new birds carved in an orcish style. The main structure is a great, simply decorated hall with a recessed <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pit-fights\" title=\"Pit-fights\">fighting pit</a> in the centre surrounded by several newer buildings, including a library for works relating to orc spirituality and one for housing items of worth related to the Imperial orc legions. One late addition is a subterranean chamber where no light is permitted - the chamber of the Abyss. Completely silent, profoundly dark and cold, some preachers meditate here to seek a greater understanding of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs_religious_beliefs#The_Howling_Abyss\" title=\"Imperial Orcs religious beliefs\">Howling Abyss</a> - and some have reported that once all external distractions are removed it can sometimes be a little easier to hear the voices of the ancestors.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Brilliant_Shore\">The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Brilliant_Shore\" title=\"Brilliant Shore\">Brilliant Shore</a></span></h3><p>The Brilliant Shore is a Bourse resource located near <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Gildenheim\">Gildenheim</a>.

There are numerous designs, and the runesmiths involved reported feeling uniquely inspired during the construction.

Another piece of imagery that figures heavily is broken chains and shackles, although it is unclear whether this is in reference to its new Imperial Orc neighbours, or something related to its own nature.

With the liberation of Skarsind, the markets were restarted but one of the most prominent - the Four-Seasons Market - was destroyed in a catastrophic fire shortly after the Winter Solstice 380YE.

The Imperial Orcs traditional distaste for mining means that while the orcs are eager for the ore beneath the hills, they have little interest in digging it out themselves. Consequently the region has a surprisingly large population of human miners, based in several bustling mining camps, operating under the watchful eyes of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Foreman_of_the_Mines_of_Gulhule\" title=\"Foreman of the Mines of Gulhule\">Foreman of the Mines of Gulhule</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gildermark\">Gildermark</span></h3><p>This region is the site of the town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Gildenheim\">Gildenheim</a>, once the primary Winterfolk settlement in Skarsind.

One of the more fertile regions of Skarsind, Gildermark has also seen the establishment of new Imperial Orcs farmsteads and farming villages, and along with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Solvihill\">Solvihill</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Southpine\">Southpine</a> the region is one of the most populous in the new Orc homeland.</p><p>During the occupation, Gildermark was the central base of operation for the Thule. Their interest in the area was possibly fired by the presence of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#The_Brilliant_Shore\">the Brilliant Shore</a> (one of the largest quarries of white granite in the Empire) but their shamans and warlocks seemed fascinated by the icy caverns beneath the town.

This has done little to dispel the reputation for oddness that the hills here have, and settlements are scattered and generally built close to the roads and travelers are advised not to wander too far into the wilderness.</p><p>This reputation was only enhanced by the presence of Pakaanan\u2019s tower, an enigmatic tower of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Mammoths\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">mammoth</a> bone that was said to be impossible to enter. During the occupation, the Thule magicians made several apparently unsuccessful attempts to breach its walls.

At some point shortly after the liberation, however, the entire tower vanished leaving behind a circular garden of dark purple heather that flourishes to this day, yet never expands beyond the area that was once encircled by the tower's walls.<br /><br />Several miles east of the site where Pakaanan's tower once stood is the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind_spoils_of_war#The_Clattering_Gulley\" title=\"Skarsind spoils of war\">Clattering Gulley</a>, a winding rock crevasse used for generations by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steinr\" title=\"Steinr\">Steinr</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_magical_traditions#Runesmiths\" title=\"Wintermark magical traditions\">Runesmiths</a> to collect mana crystals.

The scattered <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a> that dwelt here were no match for their determination to make a home for themselves; those that fled west or south would find themselves followed in short order as the Marchers pushed into Mitwold and Bregasland. Those that fled north found death at the hands of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a>.</p><p>Some of the worst fighting of the short-lived <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marches_history#Joining_the-Empire\" title=\"Marches history\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Marcher civil war</a> took place in western Upwold. One of the few pitched battles between the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marcher_household\" title=\"Marcher household\">households</a> who supported the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/First_Empress\" title=\"First Empress\">First Empress</a> and those households who opposed the formation of the Empire took place here at Hepton Bridge. Widely regarded as the bloodiest conflict of the civil war, the scrubby heathland of the battlefield is largely given a wide berth except by occasional pilgrims of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Loyalty\" title=\"Loyalty\">Loyalty</a> who come here to muse on the spiritual significance of the ancient conflict that set cousins against one another.</p><p>Today, Upwold is a wealthy territory in a wealthy nation - though unlike Mitwold a significant amount of its wealth comes from industries other than farming. While there are of course many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> in Upwold, the quick-growing silver birch woods on the eastern borders are the source of a great deal of income. Charcoal-burners live there, turning wood into easily transportable fuel for smith and hearth alike - the charcoal of Upwold provides pure fuel for the cities of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a> and the forges of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a> alike. The birch bark is used in the tanning industry, to cure the hides of the cattle that graze on the river pastures. </p><p>Upwold has always felt a certain rivalry with Mitwold to the west. There is no argument that the farms of Upwold tend not to be as fertile as those of their neighbours; the soil tends to be quite acidic. In part, this has lead to a more diverse economy - while the farm is the centre of Marcher life here as elsewhere, there are many who make their living from trees rather than crops, which occasionally attracts comment from the more agriculturally minded Mitwolders. </p><p>The people who live up here have closer links to the Navarr than many in the Marches, and more need for Beaters than most. Through the dark heart of those woods are paths no Marcher treads. From these secret ways come the painted <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feni\" title=\"Feni\">Feni</a> - uncivilised raiders, thieves, and rustlers who raid and steal from isolated settlements. To the north-west, cousins to these forests decay into the marshes that form the southern border of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_Territories\" title=\"Wintermark Territories\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Kallavesa</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a>.</p><p>Finally, Upwold is one of the few areas where anything other than beer is drunk. For centuries, the brewers of Upwold have made a drink from  the sap of the birch trees that warms their hearts in the cold winter nights but brings strange dreams.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Peter_Lambrook.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Peter Lambrook.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/1/1e/Peter_Lambrook.jpg/500px-Peter_Lambrook.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/1/1e/Peter_Lambrook.jpg/750px-Peter_Lambrook.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/1/1e/Peter_Lambrook.jpg/1000px-Peter_Lambrook.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">While the farm is the centre of Marcher life, many make their living in other ways.</div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Over the last thirty years there have been several attempts by the Jotun to attack across the border from the Mournwold. These campaigns were primarily aimed at claiming the Sutton Stone Quarries - the Jotun apparently have a great desire for white granite to help build and maintain their <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortifications\" title=\"Fortifications\" class=\"mw-redirect\">fortifications</a>. The last such attack in 372YE saw significant losses on both sides, and several new Jotun burial mounds along the southern borders.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/March_on_their_belly\" title=\"March on their belly\">disastrous failure of the Autumn harvest</a> in 379YE was followed by a particularly <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/March_on_their_belly#Resolution\" title=\"March on their belly\">harsh winter</a> during which all the farmers of the Marches suffered significant losses in order to keep the Imperial armies marching. Then the Spring 380YE planting was hit with torrential rains and a vicious blight that devoured many of the seeds before they can be put in the ground. While the rest of the Empire was enjoying a burst of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_prime_colour_of_the_world\" title=\"The prime colour of the world\">vitality and fertility</a>, the farms of Bregasland, Upwold, and Mitwold were once again labouring under the yoke of a vicious magical <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Curse\" title=\"Curse\">curse</a> that ruined the crops, sapped the life from the beasts in the fields, and spread sickness and hunger wherever it touched. </p><p>The plan to construct the <i>Imperial Breadbasket</i> may have begun in the markets of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Meade\" title=\"Mitwold\">Meade</a>, but it received immediate support from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Market_town\" title=\"Market town\">market towns</a> across the Marches. The aldermen of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Stockland\">Stockland</a> in particular were quick to put their hands in their pockets - not as an act of charity, but as recognition of the fact that when the farmers prosper, everyone in the Marches prospers. Shortly before the Spring Equinox 381YE, work was completed on a network of granaries and storehouses across Upwold as part of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_economic_interests#Granaries_and_Storehouses_-_the_Imperial_Breadbasket\" title=\"The Marches economic interests\">Imperial Breadbasket</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_work\" title=\"Great work\">great work</a>. In addition to its work in securing the future of the Marches, this has helped to improve relations between the yeomanry and the residents of the market towns - reinforcing that even though they do not till the soil, they are still Marchers.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Points_of_Interest\">Points of Interest</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stockland\">Stockland</span></h3><p>Dominating the fertile farmlands of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Stock_March\">Stock March</a>, Stockland is a sprawling town known for its sheep and cattle markets. Almost all the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marcher_household\" title=\"Marcher household\">households</a> of western Upwold take their stock here to trade, and there is a market most weekends through Spring, Summer and Autumn. In addition to its cattle and livestock markets. It is known for its raucous taverns - successful drovers and herders celebrate the sale of their livestock with a hard night's drinking, while the less successful drown their sorrows before heading home. The breweries of Stockland produce ale and beer that is exported around the Marches and across the Empire - but while it is popular it is not particularly fine. Rather, the distinctive peaty taste of the brews is immediately recognisable to anyone who has spent time in Stockland, and easily brings a lump to the throat of the homesick Marcher. The brewers of Stockland take pride in their straightforward, down-to-earth product, and are quick to scorn anyone who expresses a preference for more refined beverages.</p><p>Hepton Bridge - the site of the only major pitched battle of the Marcher civil war - crosses the Meade near Stockland. On the anniversary of the battle, monks from the Stockwater Monastery make a pilgrimage to the site and the abbot delivers a sermon from the bridge itself, generally focusing on the importance of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Loyalty\" title=\"Loyalty\">Loyalty</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a>. The monks, and the many visitors, then spend the night camped around the bridge, alert for signs of any unquiet ghosts. There have been no actual reports of hauntings in over fifty years, but the tradition endures.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Eastern_Guard\">The Eastern Guard</span></h3><p>Great crenelated walls and brooding towers look down from Eastern Guard onto the northern forest of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren\" title=\"Miaren\">Miaren</a>. Built early in the history of the Marches in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Birchland\">Birchland</a>, the garrison was initially charged both with remaining vigilant against Dawnish aggression, and with maintaining readiness for attacks from the Vallornspawn of the deep woods. Since Miaren was cleansed in the early days of the Empire, and since the people of Dawn are now an allied nation, the castle has become more open - it is a popular stopping place for merchants travelling through the central Empire. Still, the dour Marchers ensure it maintains battle readiness at all times, for one never knows when an attack may come from an unexpected direction.</p><p>During the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rocks_and_gravel\" title=\"Rocks and gravel\">great collapse</a> of Spring 381YE, most of the garrison of Eastern Guard was evacuated. Despite serious concerns, the sinkhole stopped spreading before swallowing the old castle whole, although the lip of the great dismal hole is little more than five-hundred yards from the north-eastern tower.

According to stories, Nunn appears as a prosperous Marcher steward or alderman, and has a keen interest in the interplay between those who raise crops and the traders who buy and sell them. According to local stories, at one time the herald would appear every solstice and equinox to negotiate minor deals with brave yeomen, but it has been over a century since he was last encountered.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mumford\">Mumford</span></h3><p>In western <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Stock_March\">Stock March</a> is the sleepy village of Mumford - right on the border with Upwold. Standing on the northern banks of the Meade, it marks a shallow spot in the river used for centuries by travelers and shepherds alike. North of the village, on a low and rolling rise, stands a ring of seven monoliths known as <i>the Mummers</i>.

The entertainers put on their performances, and at the end of the weekend long celebration one or another of their number is carried up to the standing stones and crowned with a wreath of daisies before being dumped unceremoniously into a vat of beer. Traditionally, the \"Earl of Mumford\" is not allowed to get out of the vat until it is empty, and the fair closes with a night of serious debauchery and celebration as the guests help the Earl drink all the beer. A bottle of beer from the Mumford Fair vat will often fetch a surprisingly high price - occasionally the alcohol is imbued with vestiges of Night magic and gains unpredictable qualities.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Bloody_Great_Hole\">The Bloody Great Hole</span></h3><p>Just over a month after the Spring Equinox 381YE a large section of north-western <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren#Goldglades\" title=\"Miaren\">Goldglades</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren\" title=\"Miaren\">Miaren</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rocks_and_gravel\" title=\"Rocks and gravel\">collapsed with an almighty roar</a> that was heard across most of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Birchland\">Birchland</a>.

Estimated to be seven hundred feet deep, with a lake at the bottom that may well be bottomless. The cliff walls are nearly vertical, and still prone to collapse in some places, but there are also signs of caves and tunnels opening out in several places. Initial explorers have excitedly reported what look to be ancient mine workings - some reaching back to the time of the Terunael, and some reaching back even further. The full extent of the network of caverns here has yet to be determined. More worryingly, some of the early daredevils who have made a preliminary investigation of some of the more accessibly caves and tunnels have failed to return - and all those who have made it back in one piece have described encounters with particularly angry <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trogoni\" title=\"Trogoni\">trogoni</a> - creatures rarely encountered outside of the mountains of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a>, and the northern peaks of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushka</a>.</p><p>The sinkhole was officially named \"<a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Delver_of_the_Depths#Lorenzo.27s_Deep_Pockets\" title=\"Delver of the Depths\">Lorzeno's Deep Pockets</a>\" by Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar, but that has not prevented many of the residents of Birchland referring to it as <i>the Bloody Great Hole</i> (perhaps a reference to Lorenzo's membership of the Bloody Butchers guild, perhaps simply a result of Marchers choosing to call a spade a spade). Some yeomen, with a grim gallows humour, prefer to call the hole <i>Downwold</i> in reference to the not insignificant amount of Upwold soil that is now at the bottom of it.

Not far from the Woldstone is the old oak wood of <b>Walksend</b>. Some of the trees here are over five hundred years old, but none have ever been felled.

According to this quaint story, on emerging from the woods of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Birchland\">Birchland</a>, the Marchers saw the rolling plains of Upwold laid out before them and knew they had reached their new home. They thrust their walking staves into the ground here to signify that they were done with marching, and the staves miraculously put forth roots, branches, and leaves and became the trees that form the forest today.

During the occupation, these emigrants kept a close eye on the border to the south; they saw it as a solemn duty to rally the rest of Upwold against any sign of Jotun aggression from their old homelands. Now that the Mournwold has been liberated, there is a great deal of discussion between the families as to whether they should seek to reclaim their old farmland.

                "description": "<p>Mitwold is arguably the richest of the Marcher territories. There's gold in the soil of Mitwold - the gold of rich harvests of fruit and grain. It has a substantial coast, scattered with small fishing villages and the occasional lonely watchtower. As one moves further inland, the rocky coast gives way to fertile chalk-soiled downs, with rich game-filled woodland, large <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a>, and prosperous <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Market_town\" title=\"Market town\">market towns</a> beyond. The largest settlement in Mitwold - indeed in the Marches - is the \"town\" of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Meade\">Meade</a>, standing proudly at the mouth of the river that shares its name. More a small city than a town, Meade is in some ways the beating heart of the Marches.</p><p>When the other nations imagine the Marches, it is usually Mitwold they bring to mind - acres upon acres of well-tended fields and orchards, laid out like a grand patchwork blanket, scattered with villages connected by roads and dirt tracks. Here and there a lonely menhir watches over the land around it, often marking a point of historical interest, or serving as a meeting place for the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Landskeeper\" title=\"Landskeeper\">landskeepers</a> of the adjoining area.</p><p>This is also the territory where many of the best known <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_culture_and_customs#Sports_and_games\" title=\"The Marches culture and customs\">ball games</a> are played, and it is a regular occurrence for some local dispute to be settled by over savage game of rugby, football or rounders. Some of the traditional inter-village or inter-household games go back centuries, having become regular fixtures long before the foundation of the Empire. Many have their own traditions - the people of Parkestown and Harwich in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Maiden_Downs\">Maiden Downs</a> compete annually to determine the  control of a prime stretch of grazing land between their two villages, for example,</p><p>More than anywhere else in the Marches, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marcher_household\" title=\"Marcher household\">households</a> of Mitwold are engaged in feuding and bitter rivalry. The closer two households are to one another, the more likely it is that they are engaged in a long-running feud. Often the original cause of the feud is lost to history, having become a self-perpetuating state of affairs as each slight delivered by a rival becomes justification for the retaliation that follows. These feuds rarely lead to bloodshed - it is a rivalry of skinned knuckles not bloodied knives.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Mitwold's history has been comparatively peaceful. Bregasland and Mournwold provide a buffer, protecting it from the martial ambitions of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a>. That is not to say it has been without incident; several times in pre-Imperial history the people of the Marches were at war with the people of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a>. Lonely menhirs and stands of ancient trees along the northern borders of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#The_Meadows\">the Meadows</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Meade_March\">Meade March</a> mark ancient, largely-forgotten battlegrounds. From time to time, stories circulate of unquiet spirits around some of the barrow mounds - bitter Wintermark warriors interred in Marcher soil.</p><p>For the most part though, Mitwold has enjoyed the benefits of being a relatively safe place to live, secure in its prosperity - or as sure as any agricultural territory reliant on good harvests can be.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/March_on_their_belly\" title=\"March on their belly\">disastrous failure of the Autumn harvest</a> in 379YE was followed by a particularly <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/March_on_their_belly#Resolution\" title=\"March on their belly\">harsh winter</a> during which all the farmers of the Marches suffered significant losses in order to keep the Imperial armies marching. Then the Spring 380YE planting was hit with torrential rains and a vicious blight that devoured many of the seeds before they can be put in the ground. While the rest of the Empire was enjoying a burst of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_prime_colour_of_the_world\" title=\"The prime colour of the world\">vitality and fertility</a>, the farms of Bregasland, Upwold, and Mitwold were once again labouring under the yoke of a vicious magical <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Curse\" title=\"Curse\">curse</a> that ruined the crops, sapped the life from the beasts in the fields, and spread sickness and hunger wherever it touched. </p><p>The plan to construct the <i>Imperial Breadbasket</i> began in the markets of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Meade\" title=\"Mitwold\">Meade</a> and received immediate support from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Market_town\" title=\"Market town\">market towns</a> across the Marches. Lead by the people of Meade, the aldermen put their hands in their pockets - not as an act of charity, but as recognition of the fact the Marches prosper when the farmers prosper. It was an investment for the future, as well as an effort to \"darn the rip\" between the folk of the market towns, and the rest of the Marches. As a result, shortly before the Spring Equinox 381YE, work was completed on a network of granaries and storehouses across Mitwold as part of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_economic_interests#Granaries_and_Storehouses_-_the_Imperial_Breadbasket\" title=\"The Marches economic interests\">Imperial Breadbasket</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_work\" title=\"Great work\">great work</a>. In addition to its work in securing the future of the Marches, this has helped to improve relations between the yeomanry and the residents of the market towns - reinforcing that even though they do not till the soil, they are still Marchers.</p><p>Shortly before the Autumn Equinox 381YE, an earth tremor struck Mitwold, its epicentre near the town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Wayford\">Wayford</a>. At first, the effects seemed minor - a little damage to some of the buildings in Wayford - but shortly after creatures similar to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ogre\" title=\"Ogre\">ogres</a> began to appear in the area. Investigations by Marcher heroes discovered that the cause of the raids - if not the earth tremor itself - was an unnatural creature, buried deep beneath the earth. \"Bloody Jack\" appeared to be some sort of horrible troll creature, no doubt the source of the local legends of Jack-in-Chains. The entity lay at the bottom of an old stone-choked well, bound with magical chains - chains that had been damaged in the earth tremor and were close to breaking completely. The creature remained a threat to Mitwold until the Summer Solstice 381YE. With the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Under_the_red_sky#Tharim\" title=\"Under the red sky\">aid of the Winter Archmage</a>, several brave yeomen made a bargain with the sinister <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eternal\" title=\"Eternal\">eternal</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Thrice-cursed_Court#Tharim\" title=\"The Thrice-cursed Court\">Tharim</a>, allowing the subterranean beast to once again be bound tightly. A menhir is due to be erected over the entrance to the well - the sooner the better in fact given that several foolish youths have already tried to gain access to the troll-creature's tomb in search of treasure. Such expeditions were decisively curtailed by the placement of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#The_Pale_Chain\" title=\"Mitwold\">the Pale Chain</a>, a white granite stone that now blocks the entrance to the well.</p><p>The business with Bloody Jack also brought to light stories of the Marcher blacksmiths - legendary figures who combined a practical appreciation for metalwork with a calling for negotiating with eternals. The exact story is still garbled, but it appears that these capable magicians disappeared from the Marches so long ago they have largely been forgotten as the result of a deal with the Autumn eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Estavus\" title=\"Estavus\">Estavus</a>. Several Marcher scholars are currently looking into the situation, and working to secure the return or release of this uniquely Marcher tradition - presuming that is even possible after all these years.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Points_of_Interest\">Points of Interest</span></h2><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Marcher_Finery.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Marcher Finery.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/b/ba/Marcher_Finery.jpg/300px-Marcher_Finery.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/b/ba/Marcher_Finery.jpg/450px-Marcher_Finery.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/b/ba/Marcher_Finery.jpg/600px-Marcher_Finery.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">Bridget Talbot, Senator for Mitwold in the difficult years after the<br />death of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Britta\" title=\"Empress Britta\">Empress Britta</a>.</div></div><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Meade\">Meade</span></h3><p>The largest settlement in the Marches is the city (technically a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Market_town\" title=\"Market town\">market town</a>; it received its charter from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Mariika\" title=\"Empress Mariika\">Empress Mariika</a> in 225 YE) of Meade in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Meade_March\">Meade March</a>. Crowded around the mouth of the eponymous river on the shores of Westmere, Meade is not only the spiritual and administrative heart for the nation, it is also a port whose ships deal in fishing, trade with foreign nations and sea defence against the barbarians through Westmere and the cold salt waters of the Gullet. </p><p>Meade is where yeomen from across the Marches come to spend hard-earned coin, and often plays host to foreign visitors from other nations. The lavish week-long Harvest\u2019s End Festival takes place in Meade every Autumn, and sees the city fill with folk from all across the Empire. Still, Meade is not without its problems. Some yeomen look askance at the citizens, questioning how they can be <i>proper</i> Marchers given they live in a town rather than on a farm. To many of their critics, they are merchants, not true yeomen. They point to the scandal during the reign of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Giselle\" title=\"Empress Giselle\">Empress Giselle</a> when several aldermen were implicated in a plot to secede from the Marches - a plot that never had much popular support but whose existence alone was enough to rekindle rumours that the folk of Meade are \"not proper.\" At the same time, the aldermen of Meade know that their settlement is not even half the size of the great cities of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a>, and this can lead to efforts to try and compete with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League_leadership\" title=\"The League leadership\">merchant princes</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato\" title=\"Tassato\">Tassato</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Temeschwar\" title=\"Temeschwar\">Temeschwar</a> with predictably disappointing consequences.</p><p>Still, regardless of the past and the attitude of some suspicious yeomen, the people of Meade are Marchers through-and-through. They are practical, stubborn people who hold fiercely to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_culture_and_customs\" title=\"The Marches culture and customs\">traditions</a> of the Marches. As their recent involvement in the formation of the Imperial Breadbasket demonstrates, when push comes to shove they look out for their own people - the people of the Marches.</p><p>In the wake of the death of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Britta\" title=\"Empress Britta\">Empress Britta</a> in 376YE, semi-organised groups of bandits began to prey on traders traveling by land from Meade.

The works were overseen by Bridget Eastville n\u00e9e Talbot (senator for Mitwold) as part of a larger plan to provide protection to towns throughout the Empire. While the defences are not sufficient to qualify Meade as a true <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortifications\" title=\"Fortifications\" class=\"mw-redirect\">fortification</a>, they have already helped reduce brigandry throughout the territory.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bailiff_of_the_Grand_Market\" title=\"Bailiff of the Grand Market\">Bailiff of the Grand Market</a> has a small office in Meade, although most title holders spend little time there (apart from to oversee the security of the grand market on the third weekend of each month).

It takes its name from the  <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Languages#Latin\" title=\"Languages\">Old Asavean</a> motto of the Talbot household - \"forte et fidelis.\" Following his retirement from Imperial politics, Richard Tunstall still serves as the castellan, ensuring that the castle is prepared for any potential invasion of Mitwold.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hay\">Hay</span></h3><p>\u201cThe golden fields of Hay\u201d appear in many a Marcher song. Hay is quintessential Marches, a small rural town set amongst rolling fields. Following the invasion of the Mournwold, the folk of Hay were been deeply concerned about the threat of further orc aggression. Several locals have formed themselves into the Hay Irregulars, an unofficial force dedicated to helping turn back the barbarians should they attempt a concerted raid. The Irregulars served with some distinction fighting off small bands of raiding Jotun, before the Mournwold was finally liberated in Autumn 381YE. </p><p>Hay is rightly famous for its fields of wheat, and for its bakeries. Many of the farmers of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Golden_Downs\">Golden Downs</a> bring their grain to market here, where a significant portion of it is used to make flour and bread products including the famous \"Hay Huffer\" - a crusty triangular bread roll with a thick, doughy texture designed to fill the bellies of labourers across Mitwold and beyond.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wayford\">Wayford</span></h3><p>A large market town at the confluence of the upper tributaries of the Meade. A layer of gritstone in between the chalk of the wolds means the river is wide and shallow, allowing livestock from the hills to cross, or embark on riverboats to Meade itself. Built along the southern borders of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#The_Meadows\">the Meadows</a>, it is a bustling settlement known for its travelers inns and for its monthly cattle and sheep markets. Merchants visiting Meade pass through Wayford, as do Marcher traders exporting food and drink to the wider Empire. The town is quite cosmopolitan - there is a large transitory population of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Winterfolk</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">League</a> citizens, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> coming to Wayford to travel.</p><p>All this propserous trade attracts its fair share of trouble, and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bailiff_of_the_Grand_Market\" title=\"Bailiff of the Grand Market\">Bailiff of the Grand Market</a> is regularly called upon to deal with bandits and brigands preying on trade along the roads that pass through Wargord. At the river fork stand several gibbets with a long and bloody history, notable in recent years for playing host to Red Walder and his outlaws, a plague on the Mitwold for many years finally brought to justice in 359YE following a week-long standoff in the Shepford Brewery near the Wayford Bridge. The town is also notable due to legends of a monstrous creature known variously as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jack_of_Irons\" title=\"Jack of Irons\">Jack-in-chains</a>, Jack-of-Irons and Bloody Jack who is said to be buried somewhere nearby. Shortly before the Winter Solstice 381YE, a menhir of white granite called <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#The_Pale_Chain\">the Pale Chain</a> was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Construct_Giant%27s_Well\" title=\"Construct Giant's Well\">raised</a> over the site where the giant is apparently entombed.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Maiden_Stone\">The Maiden Stone</span></h3><p>An ancient menhir that stands in a scorched area of land in a grove of ash trees. Every year before the Spring festival the farmers of the area weave the largest straw dolly known in the territories. The Straw Maiden, as the creation is known, is 12 feet tall adorned with wild flowers with intricate patterns of vines woven into her skirt. The Maiden\u2019s skirt is hollow at the base and she is placed atop the stone. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Landskeeper\" title=\"Landskeeper\">landskeepers</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Maiden_Downs\">Maiden Downs</a> then perform a night-long ritual designed to bring prosperity to the fields and flocks of the people of the Downs. The Maiden then stands in the grove until the end of Summer, visited by travelers who leave gifts of food, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_hearth_magic#Poppets\" title=\"The Marches hearth magic\">poppets</a>, minor trinkets, and other offerings at her foot in the hope that she may bring them some small favour. Although the Maiden is exposed to all weathers and temperaments, she does not rot, blow away or decay in any way, staying as fresh and brightly golden as the day she was placed upon the stone. Then, at the festival of Autumn Harvest there is another ceremony, the culmination of which sees the Maiden set alight, burning until there is nothing left.</p><p>Needless to say, the ceremonies of the Maiden Stone are roundly criticized by priests of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Imperial Synod</a>. There have been efforts by priests from outside the Marches to ban the practice, denounced as the worst kind of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Religious_crime#Idolatry\" title=\"Religious crime\">idolatry</a>. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sevenfold_Path\" title=\"Sevenfold Path\">Sevenfold Path</a> has occasionally attempted to get the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Conclave\" title=\"Imperial Conclave\">Imperial Conclave</a> to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Declaration#Declaration_of_Interdiction\" title=\"Declaration\">interdict</a> the ceremonies without sucess. In 186YE and 247YE, the ceremonies were stopped for a short time but in both cases resumed less than a year later.</p><p>The landskeepers of Meadow Downs claim that they are simply performing the three powerful farm-blessing <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Enchantment\" title=\"Enchantment\">enchantments</a> (<a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Blessing_of_New_Spring\" title=\"Blessing of New Spring\">Blessing of New Spring</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Strong_Ox,_Golden_Sun\" title=\"Strong Ox, Golden Sun\">Strong Ox, Golden Sun</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Gathering_the_Harvest\" title=\"Gathering the Harvest\">Gathering the Harvest</a>) and that the gifts left by visitors are simply a harmless tradition. There is some evidence that the landskeepers also perform a rite in the depths of Winter without any witnesses; lurid speculation surrounds this ceremony.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Pale_Chain\">The Pale Chain</span></h3><p>The Pale Chain is a hulking monolith of white granite from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Sutton_Stone_Quarries\" title=\"Upwold\">Sutton Stone Quarries</a> raised near the town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Wayford\">Wayford</a> shortly after the Autumn Equinox 381YE. The looming rock is engraved with a spreading oak tree above a three-link chain, giving the menhir its common name. Some rumours suggest there is a second engraving on the bottom of the stone, allegedly in the form of a peculiarly proportioned lion. The construction was plagued with problems, and vocal accusations from some of the workers that the project was cursed. One of the skilled masons responsible for shaping the stone lost her arm as the stone was lowered into place, and many of those working on the site muttered in hushed tones of similar unlikely \"accidents\".</p><p>The Pale Chain covers the well where the ravenous giant known as \"Bloody Jack\" apparently lies forever entombed. The site is watched over by a handful of yeomen from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_households#House_Guildenstern\" title=\"Prominent households\">House Guildenstern</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Stock_March\" title=\"Upwold\">Stock March</a> - something that has raised some hackles in Maiden Downs. There are also reports of a peculiar pale figure, wrapped in chains and with unpleasantly inhuman features, lurking near the stone on moonless nights - many believe this is one of the heralds of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Thrice-cursed_Court#Tharim\" title=\"The Thrice-cursed Court\">Tharim</a> that came to the Marches via the winter <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> known as the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hunters_and_wolves#In_the_Copse_of_the_Bone_Birch\" title=\"Hunters and wolves\">Copse of the Bone Birch</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Birchland\" title=\"Upwold\">Birchland</a>. According to local stories, if one approaches the stone on such nights and presses one's ear to the ground, a low rumbling voice can be heard from deep in the earth ranting and raving about thieves and liars. Local children have already begun daring one another to approach the stone and test this story out.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-left\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Householder.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Householder.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/c/ca/Householder.jpg/250px-Householder.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/c/ca/Householder.jpg/375px-Householder.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/c/ca/Householder.jpg/500px-Householder.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\"></div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Golden_Downs\">Golden Downs</span></h3><p>The rich farms of Golden Downs are home to the prosperous village of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Hay\">Hay</a>, as well as a number of smaller farming villages.

Several other stones mark the old boundaries of one farm or another but the Silent Giant is the largest. </p><p>For the last three decades, the Golden Downs has been in a state of war-readiness, expecting an invasion from the Mournwold - indeed the Jotun raided north into the region many times over the duration of the occupation. Citizen militia such as the Hay Irregulars prided themselves on their readiness to fight off such raids, even in the absence of organised Marcher armies. Many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Military_unit\" title=\"Military unit\">independent Marcher captains</a> cut their teeth taking <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Military_unit#Take_Independent_Action\" title=\"Military unit\">paid work</a> protecting the rich farms of Mitwold.

Unlike many of the Mournwold refugees the majority of these former refugees show little interest in returning to reclaim the land they (or more often their parents) lost three decades ago.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Maiden_Downs\">Maiden Downs</span></h3><p>The Downs are covered in a patchwork of wealthy and prosperous farms. Some outsiders attribute the success of the farms here to the magic of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Maiden_Stone\">Maiden Stone</a>, but the yeomen who work the land here disparage such suggestions. Rather, they point out, their farms are prosperous because they work bloody hard to keep them that way. Still, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Landskeeper\" title=\"Landskeeper\">Landskeepers</a> of the Maiden Downs have a reputation for being a little peculiar, and to be significantly more secretive than those in the rest of the Marches - almost <i><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland\" title=\"Bregasland\">bregas</a></i> in the words of some.</p><p>There are no large settlements in Maiden Downs - not even along the highway that links <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Wayford\">Wayford</a> to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold#Stockland\" title=\"Upwold\">Stockland</a>. Farmers are as likely to sell their produce in either town, depending on which is paying the better price in any given season. This has lead to a few feuds between households of Maiden Downs and those of Golden Downs and the Meadows over what is seen as \"<i>a lack of loyalty to Mitwold</i>.\"</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Meade_March\">Meade March</span></h3><p>Often called the heart of Mitwold, Meade March is the location of the small city of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Meade\">Meade</a>, built at the mouth of the river that shares its name. Meade is prosperous, and its port bustling, but the river is both too narrow and too shallow to allow passage to a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_navy\" title=\"Imperial navy\">navy</a> (<b>OOC Note:</b> the region of Meade March does not have the coastal quality). While the aldermen have occasionally discussed dredging the river to allow the construction of a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Shipyard\" title=\"Shipyard\">shipyard</a>, there has never been enough support for such a large-scale undertaking. Wiser heads also point out that while a shipyard might provide a suitable anchorage for a Marcher navy, it would also mean that Meade was placed at risk of being sacked by a barbarian navy, should one ever appear, and that tends to end the argument.</p><p>Outside of Meade, the Meade March is covered with farms and scattered villages, and even a few small towns. The yeomen here have a somewhat undeserved reputation in the rest of the Marches for considering themselves \"<i>better</i>\" than everyone else because of their proximity to Meade - of giving themselves \"<i>airs and graces</i>\". A common stereotype that appears occasionally in plays and stories is that of the Meade yeoman who farms their field wearing a rich outfit, more suited to a feast day than a work day. There is little factual foundation to this prejudice - although many yeomen of the Meade March visit the city at least once a season and thus have access to a significantly wider array of goods and cloth than residents of more isolated parts of the Marches.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Meadows\">The Meadows</span></h3><p>While most of this region is rolling farmland, the northern Meadows abuts the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesa#Wittal_Grove\" title=\"Kallavesa\">Wittal Grove</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesa\" title=\"Kallavesa\">Kallavesa</a>. The woodlands are home to at least one group of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feni\" title=\"Feni\">Feni</a>, but for the most part the Meadows is a peaceful, pastoral place. Before the Empire, however, there were occasional clashes between Marchers and raiders from Wintermarker along the border, and the northern woodlands still have an unsavoury reputation as being haunted.</p><p>South of the border, the forests that once grew in the Meadows were cleared centuries ago. Here and there between the farms however, a lone tree stands as a boundary marker and a silent reminder of a time when much of the Meadows was covered in trees. These so-called <i>Lone Oaks</i> are reminiscent in some ways of the menhirs found in other parts of the Marches. According to tales told across the Meadows, in the first years of the Marches the northern woods were home to terrible monsters who regularly attacked people trying to settle north of the Meade river. Eventually, however, a wily blacksmith made a deal with the ruler of the monsters. The creatures would leave the settlers alone if in return the Marchers stopped cutting all the trees down. In the end the Marchers had the last laugh however - they cut down almost all the trees leaving only a scattering of Lone Oaks - but by the careful wording of the agreement the monsters were unable to harm the people of the Meadows as they had kept to the letter of their bargain.</p><p>In addition to its farms and eerie trees, the Meadows is also well known for its <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Herb_garden\" title=\"Herb garden\">herb gardens</a>, especially in the north. In particular, the quality of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/True_Vervain\" title=\"True Vervain\">True Vervain</a> grown in the Meadows is generally held to be unmatched in the Marches. The herbalists of the Meadows are known to make occasional pilgrimages north to Wittal, in Kallavesa, to share lore and trade herbs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Oddmire\">Oddmire</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Coastal<br />When the Marchers first arrived in Mitwold, Oddmire was extremely marshy. Several decades of work reclaimed most of the region, despite the best efforts of angry <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marshwalkers\" title=\"Marshwalkers\">marshwalkers</a> to stop the draining of the swamps and marshes. There are still some treacherous bogs in Oddmire, especially along the southern and western borders with Bregasland, but the majority of the region is fertile farmland. As is traditional in the marches, there are large numbers of farms here, but there are also a few more isolated communities built on the small, rocky islands that lie along the southern shore of the Westmere. </p><p>The most prominent settlement here is assuredly  <b>Odd\u2019s End</b>, a bustling fishing port. The fisherfolk of Odd's End are known to have something of a chip on their shoulder when it comes to the larger, more prosperous Meade. They fly their banner - a leaping salmon - proudly whenever they set sail and barely a year passes without a major row between fisherfolk from Odds End and boats out of Meade over fishing grounds. A well-respected monastery - Odd's House - stands near the port, dedicated to the virtue of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a>, and the monks there regularly encourage the people of Odd's End to stand up for their rights against the larger Meade.</p><div class=\"box\"><div class=\"box-inner\"><b>Odd of Odd's End</b><br /> Odd of Odd's End is a popular folk hero from the early days of the Empire, born around 45YE. She was an outspoken devotee of the virtue of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a>, and in later life founded the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Monastery\" title=\"Monastery\">monastery</a> that still bears her name. Settling her folk on the shore when the Marchers first reached the Westmere, declaring that this would be the place where she would end her days, she was instrumental in the draining of Oddmire among other significant deeds. A series of stories, popular with Mitwold's mummers, recount the many deeds of this folk hero, especially her battles against marshwalkers, and her rivalry with the aldermen of Meade.<br /><br />Despite her popularity, there has been no serious effort to have Odd recognised as an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Paragons_and_Exemplars#Exemplars\" title=\"Paragons and Exemplars\" class=\"mw-redirect\">exemplar</a> by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Imperial Synod</a>. When the matter has been raised, the abbot of Odd's End generally shrugs and responds with a variant of \"We know she's an exemplar, why should we look to outsiders to confirm it?\" Regardless, \"Mother Odd\" was recognised as an exemplar of Pride in 376YE, shortly before the requirements for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Recognition\" title=\"Recognition\">recognition</a> were made stricter.

How long do you think?\"</p><p>\" It could be an hour, or as short as you...\"</p><p>Ned paused as he reached into his pouch of herbs. A decade of hunts made him grab instinctively for his pike, the mating cry of a Bregesland Dove in the wrong season could only mean one thing.</p><p>\"Cullach-A-Cullach!\" Sounded to the right, accompanied by a gurgling squeal. A moment later two Orc scouts and a human slave burst from the bushes in front of them. Ned brought the pike to bear, but not fast enough.</p><p>The smaller of the two orcs, face split with a recent wound, shoved the slave into the pike and drove her body onto the shaft. Ned drew his dagger, but the orcs were on him before the sword was free. Not relishing the prospect of a standing fight they rushed forward and bore Ned to the earth.</p><p>In a flash decision Ned dropped the dagger, grasping the wrist holding a rusty knife and breaking the nose of the second Orc.

With a butcher's confidence he sliced Split Face's neck to the bone, drenching Ned in ichor.</p><p>Ned held fast to the rusty knife, taking it from unresisting hands. As he cleared his eyes Ned heard Henry grunt and the tip of a blade emerged from his stomach. Henry toppled and Broken Nose stooped over the to pull the notched sword free.</p><p>Roaring in fury, Ned kicked Split Face's body off and launched himself forward. The notched sword was trapped and useless between them, allowing Ned free reign with the rusty knife...</p><p>Ham came to check on them once the rest of the orc scouts were disposed of. Ned sat beside the ashen body of Henry Talbot, truely still now that he had begun his journey through the labyrinth. The remains of a human and two orcs lay in the remains of the herb garden. Not a word passed between the Cullach, just a look and a nod.</p><p>With great care they removed Henry's harness and hid it up the chimney of the homestead, suspended from the meat smoking hooks. Ham took the small antler handled knife from Ned's shaking hand and cut Henry's warm heart free from his chest.

The name originally referred to the sound of the wind in the trees and across the craggy hills. Now it seems an even more fitting name; the Mournwold has become synonymous with loss and sorrow for many Marchers. </p><p>Whereas <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold\" title=\"Upwold\">Upwold</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold\" title=\"Mitwold\">Mitwold</a> in particular are known for their sprawling <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a>, the rugged Mournwold is better known for its <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a>. The hills are riddled with rich veins of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Green_Iron\" title=\"Materials\">green iron</a>, and with mine workings dedicated to extracting that ore. Prior to the invasion of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a>, there had been a growing tide of dissatisfaction among professional miners that all political power was vested in the hands of those who owned farms. There were regular complaints that mine owners, like farmers and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steward\" title=\"Steward\">stewards</a>, owned and worked land - the only difference was that the crops they raised were ore and stone rather than fruit, grain or vegetables. Some of this dissatisfaction had its roots in the sharp business practices by some of the lowland stewards, especially those of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Chalkdowns\">Chalkdowns</a>, who set high prices for the food sold to the miners.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Shadow_and_Flame.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Shadow and Flame.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/0/0a/Shadow_and_Flame.jpg/300px-Shadow_and_Flame.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/0/0a/Shadow_and_Flame.jpg/450px-Shadow_and_Flame.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/0/0a/Shadow_and_Flame.jpg/600px-Shadow_and_Flame.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">The Mournwold has been savaged by war.</div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Thirty years ago, the Mournwold fell to the Jotun <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a>. The barbarian forces that eventually defeated the Marchers amassed for months in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liathaven\" title=\"Liathaven\">Liathaven</a>. Imperial forces fought long and hard, but they were outnumbered and outmatched. The Marcher generals of the time blamed <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Throne\" title=\"The Throne\">The Throne</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Hugh\" title=\"Emperor Hugh\">Emperor Hugh</a>, for the loss, claiming that they had supported the Dawnish emperor specifically to prevent this kind of disastrous military defeat. When the Mourn fell, its last <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">Senator</a>, Thomas Overton, entered the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_culture_and_customs#The_wicker_man\" title=\"The Marches culture and customs\">wicker man</a> in an attempt to heal the breach between Marches and Empire. Despite his sacrifice, the resentment of the Marchers simmered for much of the next three decades as the generals became more focused on the recovery of the Mourn. Thomas' sacrifice was later echoed by that of Nedry Galest, General of the Tusks, who chose to enter the wicker man after the disastrous events of Spring 381YE.</p><p>After the dust settled, only the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Greensward\">Greensward</a> remained in Imperial hands. A portion of the population of the Mournwold fled when the territory fell. Most took refuge in the north, but a number of miners and hill folk from the south found sanctuary in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato\" title=\"Tassato\">Tassato</a> to the east, eventually being subsumed into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a>. Those who remained were given the Jotun <i>choice</i> - take up arms and fight for the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a> as Jotun, or lay down their weapons and become thralls. The majority of Marchers who refused to flee chose to become thralls, working their farms and providing food to their barbarian overlords. The situation changed little over the next thirty years; a few border skirmishes but no serious invasion attempt. Even <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Britta\" title=\"Empress Britta\">Empress Britta</a> made no immediate move to liberate the Mournwold; the first Imperial attempt to drive the Jotun out and reconquer the territory would not take place until after her death, and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Accept_Lasambrian_treaty\" title=\"Accept Lasambrian treaty\">collapse</a> of the temporary <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Accept_Jotun_ceasefire\" title=\"Accept Jotun ceasefire\">Jotun ceasefire</a> of 377YE - 379YE.</p><p>The liberation began after the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/379YE_Winter_Solstice_winds_of_war#The_Mourning_Wind\" title=\"379YE Winter Solstice winds of war\">Autumn Equinox 379YE</a>. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_military_concerns#The_Tusks\" title=\"The Marches military concerns\">Tusks</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_military_concerns#The_Bounders\" title=\"The Marches military concerns\">Bounders</a> were joined by both <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs\" title=\"Imperial Orcs\">Imperial Orc</a> armies and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard\" title=\"Highguard\">Highborn</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_military_concerns#The_Seventh_Wave\" title=\"Highguard military concerns\">Seventh Wave</a> at <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Overton\" title=\"Mournwold\">Overton</a>. The initial attack saw the liberation of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Ore_Hills\">Ore Hills</a>, and parts of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Freemoor\">Freemoor</a>, but also exposed the Empire for the first time to the knowledge that the Jotun had human soldiers fighting alongside them - mostly young men and women who had grown up under the occupation.</p><p>The Imperial advance <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/380YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#This_Far.2C_No_Further\" title=\"380YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">quickly faltered</a> in the face of the rage of the Jotun. Angered by the broken treaty between themselves and the Empire, the Jotun reinforced their positions in the Mournwold and brought the Empire's armies to a standstill. Three thousand Imperial soldiers died, and perhaps twice that many Jotun - a bloody cost that would set the stage for the bloodshed to follow. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/380YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#The_Heralds_of_Mourning\" title=\"380YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">Jotun counterattack</a> drove the Empire back out of Ore Hills and Freemoor - leaving the partially completed fortification there to be claimed by the orcs. The Tribute was quickly claimed by the Jotun, and became a key part of their defence of the territory in coming months. Indeed, the force of the Jotun push was sufficient to drive the Imperial forces back to Overton, nearly costing them the Greenward. By the start of the Autumn Equinox 380YE, the Jotun had <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/380YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#Loyalty_to_Great_Things\" title=\"380YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">taken Overton</a> as well, claiming complete uncontested control of the Mournwold for the first time. Their victory was short-lived - Imperial heroes managed to recapture Orchard's Watch and Overton during the Autumn Equinox, but at great cost.</p><p>After the Winter Solstice 380YE, the Greensward in southern Mourn was the site of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Let_That_Be_Your_Last_Battlefield_.28Mournwold.29\" title=\"381YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">some of the most terrible battles</a> in recent Imperial history, when the Imperial host laid a trap for the Jotun armies. With powerful magical support, immense number of humans and orcs lost their lives and most of the structures in the Greensward were leveled including the town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Overton\">Overton</a>, and the castle of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Orchard.27s_Watch\">Orchard's Watch</a>. At the same time, Spring plague and Winter magic accounted for perhaps a sixth of the remaining population, and half the people still living in the Greensward. The Jotun and the people of the Mourn alike were <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Watered_with_fears\" title=\"Watered with fears\">unprepared for the ferocity</a> of the Imperial assault.</p><p>The repercussions of these battles cannot be understated.  The Jotun morale was broken, but so was that of the people of the Mourn. The Summer solstice saw the Empire <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#You_Can.27t_Go_Home_Again_.28Mournwold.29\" title=\"381YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">make significant gains</a> in the Mournwold, but for all that they were gaining territory, they had <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/All_along_the_watchtower\" title=\"All along the watchtower\">lost the support</a> of the people who lived there. The Jotun retreated west into Liathaven, leaving token forces to defend the Tribute and the castle at Hillstop. They evacuated as many thralls - humans as well as orcs - as they could, but they put up little opposition to the Imperial troops. Indeed during the Autumn Equinox 381YE, the Jotun destroyed Hillstop rather than allow it to fall into Imperial hands.</p><p>While the Mournwold was officially imperial again by the start of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#Times_Like_These_.28Mournwold.29\" title=\"381YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">Autumn Equinox 381YE</a>, the people of the Mournwold - including for the time being a great many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold_thralls\" title=\"Mournwold thralls\">orc thralls</a> - were not shy about <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/An_apple_that_falls\" title=\"An apple that falls\">expressing their unhappiness</a> to the rest of the Empire.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Points_of_Interest\">Points of Interest</span></h2><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Farstrider%27s_Watch.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Farstrider&#39;s Watch.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f1/Farstrider%27s_Watch.jpg/500px-Farstrider%27s_Watch.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"209\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f1/Farstrider%27s_Watch.jpg/750px-Farstrider%27s_Watch.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f1/Farstrider%27s_Watch.jpg/1000px-Farstrider%27s_Watch.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">The fortification has become an unofficial place of pilgrimage for some Marcher yeofolk.</div></div><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Farstrider.27s_Watch\">Farstrider's Watch</span></h3><p>Completed shortly before the Winter Solstice 382YE, Farstrider's Watch was funded by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Lisabetta\" title=\"Empress Lisabetta\">Imperatrix Lisabetta</a>.

The castle was partially built in answer to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/An_apple_that_falls#Willing_To_Die_For_It\" title=\"An apple that falls\">calls from the citizens of the Mournwold</a> to ensure they were protected from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a> retaliation. </p><p>Farstrider's Watch was named for the beloved Marcher general Alusair Farstrider of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_households#House_Balston\" title=\"Prominent households\">House Balston</a>, who fell in battle against the western orcs alongside many of her house. While she and her follow soldiers were <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold\" title=\"Upwold\">Upwolders</a>, they are seen by many as having died fighting for the freedom of the people of the Mournwold. The castle has since become an unofficial place of pilgrimage for some Marchers, beginning with members of House Balston but spreading slowly to other parts of the Marches. General Farstrider and the \"Badger's Boys\" - the brave yeofolk of House Balston who fell alongside her - are seen in some places as inspirational figures whose loyalty, courage, and pride in their nation are inspirational. The Imperial Synod has not commented on this practice so far, although as neither the general nor any of her fellow yeofolk have been <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Recognition\" title=\"Recognition\">recognised</a> as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Paragons_and_exemplars\" title=\"Paragons and exemplars\">paragons or exemplars</a>, these pilgrims must be careful not to open themselves to accusations of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Religious_crime#Blasphemy\" title=\"Religious crime\">blasphemy</a></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Landskeeper.27s_Bulwark\">Landskeeper's Bulwark</span></h3><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> of Landskeeper's Bulkwark in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Freemoor\">Freemoor</a> was built as a physical symbol of the Empire's dedication to the protection of the people of the Mournwold. It was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_Freemoor\" title=\"Fortify Freemoor\">commissioned</a> by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> to address the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/An_apple_that_falls#Willing_To_Die_For_It\" title=\"An apple that falls\">concerns of the people</a> in the wake of the liberation of the Mourn.

The name is also a subtle nod to the desire to reincorporate the dispossessed of the Mourn back into Marcher culture. At the heart of the keep is a small orchard surrounded by a compact but well crafted garden, which serves as both a place of contemplation and a memorial to those who died driving the Jotun out of the Mournwold.<span id=\"Overton\"></span></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_ruins_of_Overton\">The ruins of Overton</span></h3><p>Once a sheep-farming town and market set on a hill, Overton was ruined early on in the great Battle for the Greensward. The majority of the defenders were killed refusing to leave their posts. Pilgrims visit the ruins of Overton to lay tokens at the graves of the fallen. North of the ruins, the Jotun raised a massive grass-covered burial mound, beneath which lie both the bodies of countless Imperial soldiers and the Jotun who fell fighting them. Apple trees grow at the crest - it is not clear whether the orcs planted them in deference to Marcher burial customs, or whether they are the work of the surviving monks of Greensward Abbey. When the Empire liberated Greensward shortly before the Autumn Equinox 381YE there was some talk of disinterring the mound, but the Marcher soldiers were adamant they be left to rest undisturbed - the soil may have been soured, but it is still the soil they died fighting for, whether they were Marchers or not.</p><p>Not far from the ruins stands <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Friar_of_Honour%27s_Rest#Honour.27s_Rest\" title=\"Friar of Honour's Rest\">Honour's Rest</a>, a small shrine and orchard tended by friars who watch over the ruins and the barrow mounds.<span id=\"Orchard.27s_Watch\"></span></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ruins_of_Orchard.27s_Watch\">Ruins of Orchard's Watch</span></h3><p><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Commission\" title=\"Commission\">Commissioned</a> by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> in Autumn 378YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_Overton\" title=\"Fortify Overton\">fortification of Overton</a> largely took place during the Jotun ceasefire.

The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> consisted of solid walls around most of the town, with a central keep. A number of buildings damaged by Jotun raids were  cleared, and apple trees planted in their place - a memorial to those Marchers who had died fighting for the Empire. The keep incorporated the old fortified manor house that served as a stop-gap defence - a base of operation for scouts gathering information about Jotun activity in the territory.</p><p>During the great Jotun offensive after the Winter Solstice 380YE, following several seasons of concerted attacks, the castle was levelled by orc siege engines.

The inhabitants resisted the Jotun for thirty years -  after an initial short-lived occupation by the Jotun they took back their village and the territory around it, dug in, and waited for help to come. Specifically, their survival hinged on an agreement with the local Jotun to let everything go to a fight-to-the-death between forces yearly rather than just be crushed. The Jotun agreed to this arrangement thinking they'd surely not hold on for more than a season or two. Instead, they held out for thirty years. In time, facing the Whittle folk in battle became a rite of passage for young Jotun in the Mournwold.</p><p>Unable to contact the outside world, lacking magical or mundane means to get word out that they were alive, they waited. While initially <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Up_on_Whittle_Hill\" title=\"Up on Whittle Hill\">welcomed</a> by their fellow Marchers when contact was re-established in Spring 380YE, it <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Will_to_survive\" title=\"Will to survive\">soon became clear</a> that they had embraced the malign spiritual power of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Malign_spiritual_presences#Hatred\" title=\"Malign spiritual presences\">hatred</a> - a power that they claimed gave them the will and the strength to resist the orcs and which they offered to share with the rest of the Marches. The Marcher assembly categorically refused their offer, encouraging the rest of the Marches to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_culture_and_customs#Shunning\" title=\"The Marches culture and customs\">shun</a> them. </p><p>When the Jotun reconquered Freemoor, the majority of the population <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/City_folk_and_country_folk\" title=\"City folk and country folk\">moved to Tassato</a> where they built a small enclave with the assistance of the city's Chamber of Commerce.

Marcher faerie tales tell of diminutive creatures who hide beneath the trees and prey on unruly children - references to a hidden <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feni\" title=\"Feni\">Feni</a> enclave deep in the woods. The Feni of Alderly occasionally raid into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Green_March\">Green March</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Chalkdowns\">Chalkdowns</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Golden_Downs\" title=\"Mitwold\">Golden Downs</a>, but for the most part they keep to themselves. During the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a> occupation, the deep woods were conquered only in theory - the Jotun controlled the grasslands beyond the forest, and the edges of the woodlands, but they did not go too deep. Likewise, when the Empire liberated the region in 381YE, they faced opposition from the Feni and settled for driving the Jotun out and claiming the lighter woodlands and the fields, rather than risk pushing too far into dangerous territory in the deeper woods.</p><p>The Marchers who live in the forest have always been considered peculiar, and three decades of isolation has intensified their strangeness. Insular and uncommunicative, the hamlets and small villages of charcoal burners and woodcutters have more than a little Feni blood, and there is some question whether the Alderly folk are even truly Marchers anymore. Regardless, however, they are still Mournwolders.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chalkdowns\">Chalkdowns</span></h3><p>A land of rolling chalk downland with close-cropped turf and dry valleys, the people of the Chalkdowns are perhaps the closest to what an outsider thinks of when they imagine Marchers. They have their own peculiarities, however. The yeomen practice a particularly Mourn form of agriculture, combining raising corn and raising sheep, whose droppings help to fertilise the cornfields when they are not grazing on the springy Mournwold turf. </p><p>Due to their emphasis on farming, the yeomen of the Chalkdowns had a somewhat disproportionate level of influence over the Mournwold, and involvement in the politics of the Marches and the Empire alike. Perhaps as many as a half of all senators for the Mournwold were picked by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steward\" title=\"Steward\">stewards</a> from Chalkdowns in the years that the Mournwold was part of the Empire. This made the Chalkdowns prosperous, and the yeomanry wealthy, but it also lead to a simmering resentment from the miners of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Ore_Hills\">Ore Hills</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Southmoor\">Southmoor</a>. During the Jotun occupation the taxes claimed by their <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orc</a> overlords impoverished even the richest, most stubborn farmers. With the Imperial liberation, it is likely that some of the yeomen who fled north (or their children) will want to return. What they will make of their new neighbours - orcs, and human thralls who endured the Jotun occupation - remains to be seen.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Freemoor\">Freemoor</span></h3><p>The wildest part of the Mournwold, Freemoor is split roughly between scrubby farmland in the west and wooded valleys in the east. The folk here had a reputation for being stand-offish on par with the people of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland\" title=\"Bregasland\">Bregasland</a>, especially those who preferred the gentle hills and woodlands of the west. Most of the farms here were never especially wealthy, but the stewards and yeomen were renowned for their stubborn refusal to go anywhere else. More Freemoor people than any other part of the Mournwold refused to leave when the Jotun came, and remained as thralls - albeit bitter, stubborn, intractable thralls.</p><p>There are three well-known landmarks in Freemoor: <i>Old Pig</i>, an aptly named chalk figure carved into the hills of the wold; the fortification of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Landskeepers_Bulkwark\">Landskeepers Bulwark</a> and <i>The Whittle Hill</i>, the largest hillock in the western Mournwold. The village of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Whittle\">Whittle</a> stands at the base of Whittle Hill, although most of its residents now live in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato#Tassato_Mestra\" title=\"Tassato\">Tassato Mestra</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Green_March\">Green March</span></h3><p>Green March was always a little odd - isolated from the rest of the Mournwold by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Alderly\">Alderly</a>, the yeomanry often felt they had more in common with the farmers of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold\" title=\"Mitwold\">Mitwold</a> than their distant neighbours in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Chalkdowns\">Chalkdowns</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Southmoor\">Southmoor</a>. The first region of Mournwold to fall to the Jotun, the site of the first engagement between the Imperial armies and the Jotun is still marked by a series of Jotun burial mounds that surround the ruins of the village of Kineton - half of them containing the bodies of soldiers who fell in a futile attempt to slow the orc advance. </p><p>Many of the citizens of Green March fled north to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Golden_Downs\" title=\"Mitwold\">Golden Downs</a>; unlike many of the Mournwold refugees the majority of them show little interest in returning to reclaim the land they lost three decades ago. </p><p>Near the border with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland\" title=\"Bregasland\">Bregasland</a> stands an odd monument called <b>High Courage</b>. Looking down across the moors towards <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liathaven\" title=\"Liathaven\">Liathaven</a>, it is a large statue of a stag with broken antlers, ascribed to the people of Terunael. On a stone block at the base of the statue Imperial letters simply read \u201cHigh Courage\u201d but it is clear that they are more recent than the statue itself.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Greensward\">Greensward</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Haunted, Ruins<br />The Greensward remains the last holdout of Imperial presence in the Mourn. The refugees and survivors who set up camp at <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Overton\">Overton</a> are gone along with the town, the offices of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sheriff_of_Overton\" title=\"Sheriff of Overton\">Sheriff of Overton</a>, and the castle of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Ruins_of_Orchard.27s_Watch\">Orchard's Watch</a>. Greensward Monastery, the abbey that once served to keep the morale of the defenders high, is now a burnt out shell amid the foothills of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman\" title=\"Kahraman\">Kahraman</a>. The soil itself is said to have become sodden with the sheer amount of human and orc blood shed during the battles over the grasslands. Tens of thousands of humans and orcs died fighting in the Greensward, and these deaths have soured the earth here.</p><p>The fields of the Greensward - the same fields that once made the stewards here rich from sales to Tassato in the east - are largely fallow. The yeomen who might have worked them fled south to Kahraman, or east to Tassato. Others chose to go west with the Jotun, turning their backs on the Empire forever. The humans who remain are primarily <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_religious_beliefs#Monks_and_Friars\" title=\"The Marches religious beliefs\">monks and friars</a>, tending to the dead, and seeking to offer some comfort to the ghosts that now haunt the Greensward.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ore_Hills\">Ore Hills</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The ore hills (sometimes rendered, unsurprisingly, as \"<i>our hills</i>\" in the drawling dialect favoured by the natives) are riddled with mine workings and quarries. The hills throughout the territory are rich in veins of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Green_Iron\" title=\"Materials\">green iron</a>, but the Ore Hills are site of some of the most prosperous mines in the Mourn - as befits the legendary birthplace of Marcher folk hero <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Jonah_Gold\">Jonah Gold</a>. Before the Jotun came, Ore Hills was the centre of dissatisfaction with the political realities of life in the Marches. In 326YE a poor harvest finally ignited the long drawn out conflict between the miners and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Chalkdowns\">Chalkdowns</a> farmers. In late Autumn a violent mob descended on the lowland farms and raided cattle and grain in a manner reminiscent of a Feni attack. The magistrates were quick to respond, arresting the ringleaders and in some cases executing the worst of them. The people of the Ore Hills still sing sad songs about this great \"injustice\" - much to the chagrin of the farmers of Chalkdowns and Freemoor.</p><p>Some of the older mines here have a bad reputation, and feature regularly in Marcher ghost-stories and cautionary tales. According to these stories <i>unnatural things</i> are occasionally sighted in the deepest parts of the oldest mines. Details are never clear and many sensible people dismiss them as either fantasy brought on by too much time without sunlight, or else ascribe the sightings to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trogoni\" title=\"Trogoni\">trogoni</a> or perhaps even the ghost of old Jonah Gold.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Southmoor\">Southmoor</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The last region to fall to the Jotun during their invasion, Southmoor is the location of <b>Sarcombe</b>, a prosperous mining town, rich off the back of trade in green iron to the Navarr in Liathaven, ruined during the last months of the orc invasion. The Jotun built a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">castle</a> over the ruins - Hillstop - and it served as their main base of operations for their occupation of the Mournwold until the Autumn Equinox 381YE. The Jotun used it to keep a careful eye eastward to the Greensward - and beyond to Tassato.</p><p>The people of Southmoor before the invasion were considered more pragmatic than their neighbours in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Ore_Hills\">Ore Hills</a>, at least as far as politics went. Sarcombe was a rich <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Market_town\" title=\"Market town\">market town</a>, and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_economic_interests\" title=\"The Marches economic interests\">aldermen</a> made little secret of the fact that they used their wealth to influence the politics of the Mournwold when they felt the need. As such there was residual bad blood between the miners in the east, and those in the west, that was occasionally exploited by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senators</a> of the Mourn. Today, the rich aldermen are gone.

Jonah is said to to have been born in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Ore_Hills\">Ore Hills</a> long before the Mournwold was part of the Marches proper; in some versions he is the son of a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato\" title=\"Tassato\">Tassatan</a> immigrant and a Marcher sheep herder. Stories say that Jonah was a miner who quarried out metal of such quality that his weapons turned the tide of war for his household during the short-lived Marcher civil war. A jealous friend betrayed him to the enemy, and for a heavy purse of coin staged a mining accident that trapped him behind a rockfall where he presumably perished. Over the centuries, a number of legends and stories have been attributed to Jonah - if the man had participated in all the stories attributed to him he would have been so busy moving around the Marches, southern Wintermark. and northern Brass Coast he would never have had time to do any actual mining!</p><p>His stories do not end with his death. His ghost is said to haunt the mines of the Marches, especially the green iron mines of the Mournwold. Superstitious miners say that to see Jonah Gold presages disaster - whether his appearance causes a catastrophe reminiscent of the collapse that killed him, or if he simply warns against them varies from legend to legend and place to place. There are even a few stories of sightings of what sounds a lot like Jonah Gold in the hills of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman\" title=\"Kahraman\">Kahraman</a>, and the old mines north of Tassato.</p><p>Some scholars who have taken the time to study the stories of his ghostly appearance disagree with the accepted wisdom that Jonah Gold is a ghost. While there is plenty of precedence for so-called \"warning ghosts\", these scholars argue that the sightings are actually of an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Astronomancy\" title=\"Astronomancy\">astronomantic</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Astronomancy#Tulpas\" title=\"Astronomancy\">tulpa</a> rather than a restless spirit - but their argument is undermined by an inability to agree on which constellation the tulpa represents.</p><p>Jonah's name has also been given to a variety of apple commonly grown in the Mournwold. Heavy, green and sweet, with a sharp bite, the \"Jonah Gold\" variety is used extensively in cooking sweet pies and apple sauce, and traditionally is buried with miners from the Mourn, particularly those who quarry green iron.</p>His story is immortalised in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jonah_Gold\" title=\"Jonah Gold\">popular song that bears his name</a>.</div></div><!-- NewPP limit reportCached time: 20220329001425Cache expiry: 86400Dynamic content: falseCPU time usage: 0.108 secondsReal time usage: 0.111 secondsPreprocessor visited node count: 7776/1000000Preprocessor generated node count: 12166/1000000Post\u2010expand include size: 2164/2097152 bytesTemplate argument size: 528/2097152 bytesHighest expansion depth: 3/40Expensive parser function count: 0/100--><!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)100.00%   81.505      1 - -total 89.78%   73.173      1 - Template:Senate_Elections  5.63%    4.587      3 - Template:Anchor  3.09%    2.520      4 - Template:CaptionedImage--></div><div class=\"printfooter\">Retrieved from \"<a target=\"_blank\"dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.ukhttps://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/index.php?title=Mournwold&amp;oldid=81468\">https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/index.php?title=Mournwold&amp;oldid=81468</a>\"</div>        <hr/><small></small>      </div>        </div><!--/span-->      </div><!--/row-->        </div><!--/.fluid-container-->        <div id=\"footer\" class=\"container-fluid\">        <div class=\"row-fluid\"><div class=\"span4\">"

The territory is primarily made up of freshwater fenland.

Many residents are concerned that the barbarians will launch a major assault through the Rushes and Gravenmarch. Bregasland has a few forts, but they are generally small, isolated, and mostly located along the western borders. Building a major fortification is hampered by the boggy ground. In recent years, the area has seen regular emplacement of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dripping_Echoes_of_the_Fen\" title=\"Dripping Echoes of the Fen\">magical fortifications</a>, raised against potential Jotun invasion by Imperial magicians.</p><p>Shortly before the Spring Equinox 381YE, and following on from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/March_on_their_belly\" title=\"March on their belly\">disasters</a> that <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/March_on_their_belly#Resolution\" title=\"March on their belly\">plagued</a> the marches during late 379YE and early 380YE, work was completed on a network of granaries and storehouses across Bregasland as part of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches_economic_interests#Granaries_and_Storehouses_-_the_Imperial_Breadbasket\" title=\"The Marches economic interests\">Imperial Breadbasket</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_work\" title=\"Great work\">great work</a>.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Points_of_Interest\">Points of Interest</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Graven_Rock\">Graven Rock</span></h3><p>This enormous smooth flat grey-stone plateau approximately 4 miles in each direction, extends from the ground with a gently sloping face of only fifty metres or so. From a great height it has the appearance of a large flat pebble buried in the ground with only its upper-level surface exposed. This unusual stone deposit sits in some of the largest expanses of dry, fertile territory in Bregasland, in the region of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland#Gravenmarch\">Gravenmarch</a>. The outer surface of the rock is covered in various entrances and doorways, which are the evidence of many hundreds of years of mining and excavation of the rock\u2019s rich mineral core. The ore deposits are largely played out today, but there are still mine workings beneath Graven Rock that are in use. It stands near the town of Graven, one of the largest settlements in Bregasland, and contributed directly to the wealth of the citizens there. Shortly before the Spring Equinox 381YE, work was completed in one of the deeper caves to create a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sinecure\" title=\"Sinecure\">sinecure</a> that provides mana to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Keeper_of_the_Dour_Fens\" title=\"Keeper of the Dour Fens\">Keeper of the Dour Fens</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fisher.E2.80.99s_Rock\">Fisher\u2019s Rock</span></h3><p>Another eerie stone protruding from the marshes, Fisher's Rock is black stone mound that emerges from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland#North_Fens\">North Fens</a> near Greywater. Atop it is a ruined tower ascribed to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Sentinel\" title=\"The Sentinel\">the Sentinel</a>. It is said to be haunted, and there are many local stories of strange lantern lights around the rock that lead people astray. The immediate area sometimes yields peculiar treasures - old cups, coins, and sometimes more significant artefacts. As a result, some of the local clannish <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Merrow\" title=\"Merrow\">merrow</a> spend their time as prospectors; although they are as likely to return bloated with giant marshspider poison as they are to return with something of interest.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rushring\">Rushring</span></h3><p>A partially submerged stone circle, the notorious site of a number of ritual killings in 365YE. It stands at the centre of one of the so-called <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland#Grey_Fens\">dead meres</a> of the Grey Fens, and both local Marchers and Feni alike give it a wide berth. Local legend claims that there are thirteen stones in the Rushring, but accounts differ wildly, in some cases claiming there are as many as thirty-nine. There are likewise many stories about what the circle represents. Some claim it is a band of Jotun orcs turned to stone by a canny landskeeper, while others claim the stones mark the site of some terrible crime or ancient magical accident, perhaps that associated with the formation of the dead meres themselves.</p><div class=\"box\"><div class=\"box-inner\"><b>Rum beasts</b><br /><p>The Marches are not <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushka</a>, but that is not to say that it is a nation devoid of magical threats. Many Marcher sailors and fisherfolk are familiar with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushkan_Monster#Rusalka\" title=\"Varushkan Monster\">dangerous shapeshifters</a> that can be found in the Gullet, for example. Ghosts and hauntings are uncommon, but known across the Marches. Strange creatures of the realms may be found anywhere there are <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a>. </p><p>Nowhere else in the Marches, however, are there quite so many stories of odd beasts and dangerous spirits as Bregasland. How real these creatures are is hard to say for certain. Western Bregas swear that the fens are home to eerie nocturnal ebon hounds that spell disaster for anyone who looks at them too closely. Wherever there is deep water, hungry bogs, or shifting paths there are stories of floating lights that lead travelers astray which are said to be the hateful spectres of men and women who drowned alone in the swamps.There are said to be certain trees that hate humans, and kill lone travellers with magical lures and strangling roots. Some of the people allegedly falling prey to these threats are likely the victims of Feni, or bandits, or their own poor luck traversing trackless marsh. Yet there are dangerous mundane creatures as well - the most common natural threat to Bregas are the giant marshspiders whose natural ability to camouflage themselves against the mud and the rushes and lethal venom makes them an uncommon, but potentially fatal, threat to the unwise. </p>Marcher characters from the fen are encouraged to come up with local folk tales of dangerous monsters from the deep fens, with an eye toward eerie, misunderstood threats appropriate to folklore rather than more traditional tabletop roleplaying monsters.</div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gravenmarch\">Gravenmarch</span></h3><p>Gravenmarch borders <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold\" title=\"Mitwold\">Mitwold</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold\" title=\"Mournwold\">Mournwold</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liathaven\" title=\"Liathaven\">Liathaven</a>, and is sometimes called \"<i>the only dry spot in Bregasland</i>\" (<b>OOC Note:</b> Unlike the rest of Bregasland, Gravenmarch does not have the marsh quality). The soil here is fertile, and the gentle eastern hills and well-irrigated western fields are dotted with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a>, villages, and hamlets. The largest settlement in Bregasland, the town of <b>Graven</b> is found here, in the shadow of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland#Graven_Rock\">Graven Rock</a>. The town grew rich from a combination of high fields and the mineral wealth extracted from the Rock. In happier times <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> merchants and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Striding\" title=\"Striding\">stridings</a> regularly passed through on their way north from Liathaven, with news and trade-goods from far afield. As with many parts of Bregasland, the people of Graven have a reputation for being odd - but in this case it is due to the number of them who started their lives far away and were brought here by a Navarr <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr_religious_beliefs#guide\" title=\"Navarr religious beliefs\">guide</a>. Today, Graven is known for the good quality stone it supplies to construction efforts across the Marches, and for the garrison that keeps a wary eye on the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a> of the forest and the Mourn.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Grey_Fens\">Grey Fens</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Marsh<br />The Grey Fens are the deepest, darkest parts of Bregasland. The exact location of the western border is a matter for some debate - it is impossible to say where Bregasland ends and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hordalant#Blutgahn\" title=\"Hordalant\">Blutgahn</a> marshes of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hordalant\" title=\"Hordalant\">Hordalant</a> begin. The area is one of the least populated parts of the Marches, with a scattering of isolated hamlets that very much keep themselves to themselves. There is believed to be at least one large clan of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feni\" title=\"Feni\">Feni</a> in Grey Fens, although the nature of their relations with the Imperial citizens in the area is largely unknown.</p><p>The Grey Fens have a number of so-called dead meres - open areas of standing water where no fish are found. The water is clear and appears fresh, but drinking it leads to crippling stomach cramps and, if the imbiber is already weak, may result in death. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Landskeeper\" title=\"Landskeeper\">Landskeepers</a> have studied the dead meres in the past, but about all they have discovered is that they are the result of some ancient curse. Locals know to stay away from the dead meres; on nights of the new moon the water is said to glow with an eerie, pale effulgence that is said to cause madness in anyone exposed to it. One of the best known  of the dead meres is the one that surrounds the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland#Rushring\">Rushring</a> stone circle.<br /></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"North_Fens\">North Fens</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> Marsh, Coastal<br />To the west of North Fens lie the southern Jotun kingdoms, while its northern border runs along the southern coast of the Gullet. The shore is scattered with small fishing villages. As one travels west, each village is said to be a little more insular until the westernmost villages and farms of North Fens are said to border on the xenophobic. North Fens is the site of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland#Fisher.27s_Rock\">Fisher's Rock</a>. </p><p>The largest settlement in North Fens is <b>Greywater</b>, which is said to mark the furthest west that any wise Marcher will go. The locals make their living primarily from eel-fishing, but since this isn\u2019t a trade that leads to many exports, some of the more daring among them will scour the surrounding marsh for unusual plants and flowers. These are dried, and sold through the markets at Meade for study across the Empire. The small town takes its name from slip clay stirred up by frequent storms: it\u2019s not the best water to drink. A thriving market in pure water exists here, with fresh water from the estuary left to settle in vast oak tanks and then carefully decanted. \"<i>Too poor to drink water</i>\" is a local phrase applied to the truly destitute, who are forced to drink dirty water.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ottermire\">Ottermire</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Marsh<br />Along the shores of the Westmere stretched Ottermire. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Yeoman_of_the_Marches\" title=\"Yeoman of the Marches\">yeomanry</a> here are roughly split between fishing the deep waters of the Westmere, and tending to herb gardens and mana sites deeper in the marshes. The most populous settlement in Ottermire is <b>Ottery</b> which stands at the western end of <i>Odd's Way</i>, and at the northern end of the <i>Sallow Walk</i>. Both roads are notable because they are built atop thick packed-earth causways, crossing the marshes to Odd's End in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Oddmure\" title=\"Mitwold\">Oddmure</a> and Sallow in the south respectively. Locals, of course, refer to both causways as <i>the Otterway</i>, differentiating between the two by stressing the first or second syllable, this causes endless confusion among outsiders. The town itself is a small fishing port that trades the produce of the marshes to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Meade\" title=\"Mitwold\">Meade</a> and, has a history of sending boats across the Westmere to trade with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Winterfolk</a>. </p><p>There are many local stories of boats travelling across the Westmere to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesa\" title=\"Kallavesa\">Kallavesa</a>, and a number of the Marcher families here show signs of having Wintermark blood in their ancestry. Indeed, the area is notable even among the notoriously eerie Bregas for adoption of certain <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mystic\" title=\"Mystic\">mystic</a> practices - albeit seen through the lens of stubborn Marcher tradition and allegedly distorted enough that they are barely recognisable to their northern practitioners.<br /></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Rushes\">The Rushes</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Marsh<br />The Rushes are marshy, like most of the rest of Bregasland, but the further south one goes the more solid the ground becomes. In southern Rushes there are a few more traditional farms, raising crops not unfamiliar to Marchers from Mitwold and Upwold. The most common industry in the Rushes, perhaps unsurprisingly, is cutting and drying rushes for use in roofing and flooring across the Marches.</p><p>The only settlement of note here is <b>Sallow</b>, which lies at the southern end of the <i>Sallow Walk</i> that connects the region with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland#Ottermire\">Ottermire</a> in the north. Sallowfolk keep themselves to themselves to a degree found off-putting even by other Bregaslanders. Behaving in a manner the folk of Sallow find too familiar, or prying too closely into local affairs, can sometimes result in long knives being drawn - the same long knives they use to cut the rushes that are the main export of the area. Someone bearing a <i>Sallow-cut</i> is recognised across Bregasland as someone who takes liberties, or has a little too much interest in the doings of their neighbours.</p><p>A common slur directed at the people of the Rushes, and at Sallowfolk in particular, is that they have closer relations with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feni\" title=\"Feni\">Feni</a> than is either wholesome or legal. People of the Rushes take such accusations extremely personally although many of them do not even bother to refute them before reaching for their rushing knives.<br /></p><div style=\"float: right; width=300px; margin-right:10px; margin-left: 10px; clear: right;\"><table><tr><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Summit</th><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Elected</th></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 382YE</td><td>Orrick</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 381YE</td><td>Orrick</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 380YE</td><td>Orrick</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 379YE</td><td>Orrick</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 378YE</td><td>Orrick</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 377YE</td><td>Orrick</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 376YE</td><td>Richard of Bourholt</td></tr></table></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_Senate_Elections\">Recent Senate Elections</span></h2><p>As an Imperial territory, Bregasland is represented by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> elected in the Winter.

In ancient times it was the centre of the troll kingdom, but today is considered the ancestral homeland of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steinr\" title=\"Steinr\">Steinr</a> in Wintermark. The other passes through the mountains are likewise protected by fortified halls, preventing access to the rolling hills that drop down towards fertile plains.</p><p>In the oldest days, before the coming of the Steinr, Hahnmark was the heart of the troll kingdoms and it was here that the three peoples first came together to oppose their enemies, and to create the union that has made their people the strongest in the world. The peaks of eastern Hahnmark are scattered with relics from the troll kingdom, mostly ruined and empty, or haunted by malignant spirits who hate the people of the lowlands with an endless, frigid spite. The higher peaks are avoided by sensible folk as a consequence.</p><p>Hahnmark is a rugged land, like the people who call it home. A slight majority of the population are Steinr, but as always there is a nearly equal presence of Suaq and Kallavesi people in its prosperous halls. The people of the rolling hills enjoy a high level of prosperity, their wealth coming from trade with other Imperial nations; from the mines and farms of the mountains and the flatlands; and from the strong sword-arms of its warriors.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">Senator</a> for Hahnmark is appointed by the Steinr during the Autumn equinox, and is almost invariably from Steinr stock.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>During the invasion of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a>, many refugees came down through <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Pakaanan.27s_Pass\" title=\"Skarsind\">Pakaanan's Pass</a> to find temporary homes in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Northspires\">Northspires</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Bruckland\">Bruckland</a>. Since the territory has been reclaimed, many are returning to their homes - although a number have chosen to stay permanently in Hahnmark. Concerns that the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> might come further west and invade Hahnmark proved groundless, but there were repeated calls for the Hall at <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Kalpaheim\">Kalpaheim</a> and the vigilant <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Northspires\">Stormspires</a> to be reinforced and further fortified. Successive <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Senates</a> failed to agree to the amount of white granite needed, and the projects were largely abandoned.</p><p>Shortly after the Spring Equinox 381YE, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#The_Dunsfall_Sinkhole\" title=\"Hahnmark\">great sinkole</a> swallowed parts of south-eastern <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Wood_Heath\">Wood Heath</a> displacing several halls. It also displaced a group of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feni\" title=\"Feni\">Feni</a> that once dwelled in the deep woods there. Some of the group went south into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold\" title=\"Upwold\">Upwold</a>, but the remainder <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Right_now#Feni_March\" title=\"Right now\">remained in Hahnmark</a> where their raids became <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Everything_has_rhythm#Feni_Fight_Ferociously\" title=\"Everything has rhythm\">increasingly</a> problematic as 382YE <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Make_good_use#The_Feni_in_the_Mark\" title=\"Make good use\">progressed</a>. During the Summer Solstice, the heroes of Wintermark confronted the raiders and offered them the chance to leave Hahnmark safely provided they brought their raids to an end.

Once the capital of the entire nation, this is the site of the original joining of the three cultures. The settlement circles a stone fortress built in the first days after the defeat of the trolls - the Hall at Kalpaheim - parts of which extend into tunnels dug deep beneath the mountains. A prosperous hub for trade with other nations, Kalpaheim guards a large pass through the mountains that serves as a major trade-route down into the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marches</a>, and the rest of the Empire. Other valuable trade routes include those to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia\" title=\"Hercynia\">Hercynia</a> in the north-west, and through the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> territory to the forests and mines of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a> and ultimately <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushka</a>.</p><p>As well as safeguarding the prosperity of Hahnmark, Kalpaheim is a central feature in the heritage of the Winterfolk. The <b>Face of King Ulmo</b>, an immense carving of the first monarch of Wintermark, looks down upon Kalpaheim from the side of one of the western mountains. It serves as a reminder that the eyes of history are upon the town and the people of Wintermark. This impressive feat is one of the wonders of the Empire, constructed long before the nation joined the Empire by a trio of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_Magical_Traditions#Artok\" title=\"Wintermark Magical Traditions\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Artok</a> under the control of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_Magical_Traditions#Icewalkers\" title=\"Wintermark Magical Traditions\" class=\"mw-redirect\">icewalker</a> Gilda Heimssdottir. She also dug out most of the tunnels that parts of the hall now occupy.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Fingers\">The Fingers</span></h3><p>When the Steinr travelled through mountain passes to find the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Suaq\" title=\"Suaq\">Suaq</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesi\" title=\"Kallavesi\">Kallavesi</a>, they sought guidance in visions. It is said that this high-mountain with its four jagged peaks rose above the mist in the early daylight, pointing out the way. It is now home to a religious settlement called The Fingers, where the virtues that founded Wintermark are celebrated; the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Courage\" title=\"Courage\">Courage</a> to carry such a bold plan through, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a> gained through the trials of the journey, and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Loyalty\" title=\"Loyalty\">Loyalty</a> that now joins the three peoples.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gulnar.E2.80.99s_Deeps\">Gulnar\u2019s Deeps</span></h3><p>An old series of copper mines in northern <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Kalpamark\">Kalpamark</a> that unexpectedly broke into a much larger cave network beneath. The full extent of the caves has never been mapped, since ice and meltwater make much of it treacherous, but a wealth of minerals and metals now comes from the deeps.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Runegrott\">Runegrott</span></h3><p>In southern <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Northspires\">Northspires</a> is found a vast labyrinthine chamber in the ice, in which many runes are carved. They are thought to be very old, and some scholars argue that the origin of runes in Wintermark lies here, rather than in the caves beneath <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Gildenheim\" title=\"Skarsind\">Gildenheim</a>. The chamber is carefully guarded. It is a matter of debate as to whether the runes bear any message -- some claim the original laws of Wintermark, and thus the Empire -- were taken from the inscriptions in this chamber.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Dunhall\">New Dunhall</span></h3><p>In 381YE Arnburh, the Dunhearth Hall and neighbouring Woodhall <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rocks_and_gravel\" title=\"Rocks and gravel\">fell into a massive sinkhole</a>. Forewarned by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a>, the Thane and Redfeldr were able to evacuate the town. During the Summer Solstice 381YE, plans were laid for a grand Wintermark trading town. The purpose of New Dunhall is four-fold: to re-establish and protect trade between Wintermark and the Marches; to serve as a base of operations for mining <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Delver_of_the_Depths#Lorenzo.27s_Deep_Pockets\" title=\"Delver of the Depths\">Lorenzo's Deep Pockets</a>; and to provide a defence against any <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trogoni\" title=\"Trogoni\">fell creatures</a> that might come out of the deep earth. Work was begun almost immediately, and the majority of the construction completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox.</p><p>At the heart of the new town is a large market overseen by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Caretaker_of_New_Dunhall\" title=\"Caretaker of New Dunhall\">Caretaker of New Dunhall</a>, intended for commodity trading and the sale of the Dunning\u2019s fine artisan goods. A new Dunhearth Hall was built, larger and richer than the old hall, destroyed in the collapse. Along with the various barracks, supporting buildings, and defensible walls, New Dunhall represents a fine example of a Wintermark town, dedicated to the continuing security of the area.</p><p>Not far from New Dunhall is found <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fallsheart_Guardian#Fallsheart_Cave\" title=\"Fallsheart Guardian\">Fallsheart Cave</a>, a cavern exposed shortly after the sinkhole collapse which is a rich source of crystal mana. A Guardian is appointed to protect the cave, which is at some risk from hungry trogoni.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lorenzo.27s_Legacy_of_Vigilance\">Lorenzo's Legacy of Vigilance</span></h3><p>Spread across the entire territory of Hahnmark are a number of red stone <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.ukhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stele\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\">stelae<i class=\"icon-share-alt\"></i></a>.

Situated in a handful of locations through <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Kalpamark\">Kalpamark</a> are great weirwood grain silos banded in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Weltsilver\" title=\"Materials\">weltsilver</a> with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Orichalcum\" title=\"Materials\">orichalcum</a> rivets. Each silo is supported by several smaller buildings that are always busy collecting and distributing grains, meats, fur, and other farming supplies, all day every day. The rune <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pallas\" title=\"Pallas\">Pallas</a> is inlaid over each silo, and the men and women who operate them take great pride in ensuring the buildings are well lit so that they are visible almost as beacons once the sun sets. Smaller silos are scattered across the territory, at least one in each region.

Parts of that south-eastern region soon followed north-western Goldglades into the spreading hole. Thanks to the Navarr, Dunhearth Hall, Woodhall and several smaller halls were all evacuated in time to avoid major loss of life.</p><p>Where Hahnmark once bordered Miaren, there is now a massive <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.ukhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinkhole\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\">sinkhole<i class=\"icon-share-alt\"></i></a>. Estimated to be seven hundred feet deep, with a lake at the bottom that may well be bottomless. The cliff walls are nearly vertical, and still prone to collapse in some places, but there are also signs of caves and tunnels opening out in several places. Initial explorers have excitedly reported what look to be ancient mine workings - some reaching back to the time of the Terunael, and some reaching back even further. The full extent of the network of caverns here has yet to be determined. More worryingly, some of the early daredevils who have made a preliminary investigation of some of the more accessibly caves and tunnels have failed to return - and all those who have made it back in one piece have described encounters with particularly angry <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trogoni\" title=\"Trogoni\">trogoni</a> - creatures rarely encountered outside of the mountains of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a>, and the northern peaks of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushka</a>.</p><p>The sinkhole was officially named \"<a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Delver_of_the_Depths#Lorenzo.27s_Deep_Pockets\" title=\"Delver of the Depths\">Lorzeno's Deep Pockets</a>\" by Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar, but is commonly known among the people of Hahnmark as \"The Dunsfall\".</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Beacons_of_Wintermark\">The Beacons of Wintermark</span></h3><p>Shortly before the Spring Equinox 383YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Starting_at_the_end#Towers_of_Fire\" title=\"Starting at the end\">beacons of Wintermark</a> were completed, covering Hahnmark and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesa\" title=\"Kallavesa\">Kallavesa</a>.

Fruitless attempts to domesticate the mammoths have largely been abandoned, but there are a few stubborn mammoth herders in Bruckland who follow the herds and occasionally harvest an old or injured member for ivory, hide and meat.<br /><br />The most famous settlement in Bruckland, the fishing hamlet of <b>Turelva</b> lies across the waters of Kronevann from Kronehal. The two settlements enjoy a friendly rivalry in all matters; an annual fishing contest between the two has become a four day festival which boasts attendees from as far afield as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawn</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kalpamark\">Kalpamark</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The heartland of Hahnmark, site of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Kalpaheim\">Kalpaheim</a> and the face of King Ulmo. The halls of Kalpamark are some of the most prosperous and influential in Hahnmark - possibly in the whole of Wintermark. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Gatekeeper_of_Falling_Snow#The_Garden_of_Falling_Snow\" title=\"Gatekeeper of Falling Snow\">Garden of Falling Snow</a> stands in the high peaks here, constructed around a series of bubbling hot springs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kronemark\">Kronemark</span></h3><p>The flattest part of Hahnmark, the downs of Kronemark are a patchwork of fishing villages and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a>. The largest settlements sprawl around the shore of the icy lake Kronevann, or along the many streams that connect it to its sister lakes in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Bruckland\">Bruckland</a>. The best known of the settlements on the Kronevann is <b>Kronehal</b>. Claimed as the home of Sigrid Alvsdottir, legendary champion of the Steinr who slew Vatr, the one-eyed warleader of the trolls and as her reward claimed the crown of the Steinr.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Northspires\">Northspires</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The hills and mountains of Northspires are a rich source of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Orichalcum\" title=\"Materials\">Orichalcum</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Tempest_Jade\" title=\"Materials\">Tempest Jade</a>. Some of the highest peaks in Wintermark are found here, and there are scattered ruins on the upper slopes that date back to the height of the troll kingdoms. Several halls look down across the rest of Hahnmark from here, the most famous of which is probably <b>Stormspire</b>. A remote fortress and watchtower whose commander is often titled \u2018the Eyes of the North\u2019, Stormspire keeps a careful watch on any traffic from the North. One of the key major beacons, the folk of Stormspire also maintain and staff a smaller network of beacons on nearby peaks.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Southridge\">Southridge</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />In the years before the foundation of the Empire, the rolling downs and woodlands of Southridge were the site of regular skirmishes between the Winterfolk and the Marchers. These came to an end with a final peace treaty, signed at the settlement of <b>Moot</b>. Grim-faced folk drew lines on maps and agreed to fight orcs, not each other. The place of meeting grew into a small trading settlement where Marcher grain goes north, and Wintermark sends its worked metal and leather south. Despite nearly five centuries of relative peace, however, there are occasional tales of haunted battlefields and unfortunate incidents with rowdy Marchers who ought to know better.<br /><br />The woodlands and rugged gulleys of Southridge are also home to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feni\" title=\"Feni\">Feni</a> who mostly keep to themselves but occasionally engage in banditry against travellers or poorly defended halls.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Valasmark\">Valasmark</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />Rugged Valasmark slopes down towards the cold fens of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesa\" title=\"Kallavesa\">Kallavesa</a> to the south-west. In a populous valley near the centre of the region stands <b>Valashal</b>, a Hall almost entirely peopled by groups of Steinr, accepting warriors from all over the nation. Its stated intent is to be the greatest focus of martial heroism in the country and therefore the world. The current great hall was constructed by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Guntherm#Death_and_Legacy\" title=\"Emperor Guntherm\">Brigid, daughter of Emperor Guntherm</a> in 248YE in honour of her father. It was built on the site of a much older hall, the Runehall, which legend claims was constructed by a Troll the scops named The Torn Light of Night Falling. The Runehall was a vast beautiful edifice, but it was said to be cursed and any thane who claimed it as their seat met an untimely end.</p><p>Brigid razed the Runehall to the ground and had fresh timber and stone brought in to construct a new hall. She named it Valashal, and declared that it would be dedicated to training the greatest warriors of the nation in memory of her father. Whitehall has prospered since that day, attracting young <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steinr\" title=\"Steinr\">Steinr</a> from all over Hahnmark who come to Valasheim seeking to earn a name for themselves. In 334YE the settlement was expanded to build the Galenhall, to house the many scops who had come to Valasheim to celebrate the deeds of the heroes who dwell here.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wood_Heath\">Wood Heath</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />On the edge of the forests on the southern side of Hahnmark stood the bustling logging town of <b>Woodhall</b> which supplied a great deal of the wood, charcoal and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Beggar.27s_Lye\" title=\"Materials\">Beggar's Lye</a> for Wintermark\u2019s building, crafting and smithing.

Without warning, however, Woodhall was destroyed - in Summer 381YE a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rocks_and_gravel\" title=\"Rocks and gravel\">massive sinkhole</a> opened up that swallowed Woodhall, along with nearby Dunhearth, and the settlement of Arnburh.

A talented <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_culture_and_customs#Art_and_history\" title=\"Wintermark culture and customs\">scop</a> from an early age, he was famous not only for his beautiful singing voice but also for his good heart and willingness to see the best in people. He quickly learned all the lessons his master had to teach him, and went on a great pilgrimage around Wintermark visiting halls across the nation to study with the scholars, musicians, and poets among his people.<p><br />A proud Steinr, he was never afraid to get his hands dirty - while he would often repay the hospitality of his hosts with music and poetry during the evenings, he spent his days sparring with their warriors, teaching their children, and working in their fields. A competent warrior, he <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_military_concerns#Banner-bearers\" title=\"Wintermark military concerns\">bore banners into battle</a> against <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feni\" title=\"Feni\">Feni</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marchers</a> with equal enthusiasm.</p><p>The most famous tale about Theodric involves the bloody enmity between two rival generals in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Kronemark\">Kronemark</a> - the thane of Geranshal and her distant cousin the thane of Eilashal. Queen Linna called the two together to settle their differences but matters quickly escalated out of control - neither of the well-loved heroes could abide that the other drew breath. Blades were drawn by the thanes and the warriors from their halls. For a moment it seemed like the Queen's hospitality would be cast aside and the blood of one hero or another spilled in her hall, with potentially disastrous consequences for Hahnmark.</p><p>Before the first blow could be struck, Theodric stepped into the space between the feasting tables and began to sing. The Queen was quick to act - no fighting should take place while the scop sang. The two generals were forced to agree, and took the opportunity to prepare for the fight to come. To their surprise, however, Theodric sang for three days and three nights straight without faltering or repeating himself once. He moved the warriors to weeping for their own foolishness, and still he did not stop until exhaustion had claimed every other person in the Queen's hall - by which time cooler heads had prevailed. Over the next several days the thane of Gernashal and the thane of Eilsashal were able to settle their differences and, according to the stories, became close friends who fought beside each other on many battles.</p><p>Theodric is also known to have travelled for a time with the Dawnish exemplar <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Elayne_Silverlark\" title=\"Elayne Silverlark\">Elayne Silverlark</a> and her companion Lord Endric. The priests of Wintermark say that he taught her much about heroism, and just as much again about the proud arts of the scop. When she returned at last to Dawn, she took many of his songs and tales with her and paved the way for a better understanding between her people and the people of the Mark. For his part, Theodric is said to have learned to play several instruments previously unknown in Wintermark, and introduced several of them to his fellow scops as he continued his travels around Wintermark.</p>The scop himself lived to a ripe old age, and decided shortly after his seventieth birthday to head north and \"explore Sydanjaa - to finally find out what rests at the heart of the eternal storm.\"</div></div><!-- NewPP limit reportCached time: 20220329001427Cache expiry: 86400Dynamic content: falseCPU time usage: 0.105 secondsReal time usage: 0.108 secondsPreprocessor visited node count: 7677/1000000Preprocessor generated node count: 11986/1000000Post\u2010expand include size: 2151/2097152 bytesTemplate argument size: 211/2097152 bytesHighest expansion depth: 3/40Expensive parser function count: 0/100--><!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)100.00%   80.856      1 - -total 93.92%   75.939      1 - Template:Senate_Elections  2.91%    2.353      1 - Template:Anchor  2.53%    2.048      2 - Template:CaptionedImage--></div><div class=\"printfooter\">Retrieved from \"<a target=\"_blank\"dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.ukhttps://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/index.php?title=Hahnmark&amp;oldid=87729\">https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/index.php?title=Hahnmark&amp;oldid=87729</a>\"</div>        <hr/><small></small>      </div>        </div><!--/span-->      </div><!--/row-->        </div><!--/.fluid-container-->        <div id=\"footer\" class=\"container-fluid\">        <div class=\"row-fluid\"><div class=\"span4\">"

The land changes through the seasons, but always has a feeling of brooding stillness. In the warmer months it is a boggy marsh cut through with streams and fjords. In the winter the waterways freeze over and the whole land is covered with frost and snow. The marsh serves as the national graveyard and this is a place of ancient secrets and mysticism. </p><p>It is a mournful land, but a beautiful one. Thanes' halls are traditionally constructed entirely from wood here and those built in marshy areas are raised up on stilts. Many halls in Kallavesa are built around sacred places or places with a magical reputation.

Wry comments were made concerning how people who thought the \"Anvil mud\" would react to what the people of Kallavesa call \"dry land\". The completion of the project became a point of pride, and donations came in from across Wintermark.</p><p>Surveyors planned an optimal route through the marshes, intended to minimise the number of bridges required while at the same time ensuring the trails passed through as many communities, and past as many shrines and resting places as possible.

The builders were determined that the trails would be completed in time that the body of Guthwulf would be the first to pass along them. The last blocks for the last bridge were placed as the funeral procession was mere paces away. As the procession was crossing, in a flash of inspiration a builder who had not yet put their tools away carved into the side of the bridge the name of the egregore, Guthwulf of the Red Embrace.</p><p>The name was soon joined by that of the other fallen heroes of Wintermark who travelled across it, and in other parts of the Pilgrim's Trail mourners have begun carving the names of the dead into the fabric of the last bridge they cross on their way to their final resting place in the waters of Kallavesa.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Beacons_of_Wintermark\">The Beacons of Wintermark</span></h3><p>Shortly before the Spring Equinox 383YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Starting_at_the_end#Towers_of_Fire\" title=\"Starting at the end\">beacons of Wintermark</a> were completed, covering <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark\" title=\"Hahnmark\">Hahnmark</a> and Kallavesa.

The forests and tundra of this territory are rich with animal life that sustains the Winterfolk, ranging from great furred beasts to small game and hunting birds. The northern waters are home to seals and penguins, and full of fish and whales. As one travels further north, the land becomes colder and colder until a traveller comes to transient ice floes that mark the farthest extent of the land claimed by the Winterfolk. This fertile territory is under constant threat from both the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a> whose hunting parties also seek to exploit the profusion of life here, regularly engaging in skirmishes with the Winterfolk who live here.</p><p>Sermersuaq is notable for the interconnected freshwater lakes of Lansipari, Ittanpari, Atkonaroq, Sarda, Rikkivesi and the Eastern Floes. Deep and frigid, often dotted with chunks of floating ice in the coldest winters, perhaps half the area of Sermersuaq is made up of these frigid \"inland seas.\" these massive waterways teem with fish and are said to be connected to each other by flooded underground passages and the lakes on <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesa\" title=\"Kallavesa\">Kallavesa</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark\" title=\"Hahnmark\">Hahnmark</a>. Old stories speak of the lakes being \"<i>carved by mountains</i>\" in some fashion. There are many halls built along the shores of the lake who prosper through fishing and occasionally trading across the cool waters.</p><p>Beyond the ice floes is the wasteland of Tsirku, where the ground is permanently covered in snow. The landscape is far from flat, there are ice plateaus pock-marked with crevasses and areas where the ice is rent apart giving way to cold salty lakes. Here rages the eternal ice-storm Sydanjaa, a roaring blizzard that blows all year round and from whose depths no traveller has ever returned.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">Senator</a> for Sermersuaq is appointed by the Suaq during the Summer solstice, and is almost invariably from Suaq stock.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>In the Winter of 370YE the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a> invaded in force, taking <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Stark\">Stark</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Tanikipari\">Tanikipari</a>. Before they could consolidate their hold, however a joint campaign by Wintermark and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marcher</a> armies drove them out under the leadership of a young Skarsind general named <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Britta\" title=\"Empress Britta\">Britta</a>.  Without her excellent leadership and inspirational presence is it widely believed that both Sermersuaq and Kallavesa would have been lost to the orcs. Further attempts at invasion were stymied by the re-vitalised and re-equipped armies left behind to guard against another attack. </p><p>With their eyes focused on the western and eastern borders, however, the Empire was unprepared for the invasion of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a> in 373YE. Following that invasion however, the intensity of Thule raids actually declined a little as their forces focused on stripping the fallen Wintermark lands. Now that the easternmost of the Winterfolk territories is back in Imperial hands, it is assumed that the frequency of raiding bands coming through the mountains will begin to increase again. By contrast, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Accept_Jotun_ceasefire\" title=\"Accept Jotun ceasefire\">Jotun ceasefire</a> has lead to <i>more</i> Jotun raids from the west, as barbarian warriors denied the opportunity to face Winterfolk in battle have sought other outlets.</p><p>In 378YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> sent armies from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Otkodov\" title=\"Otkodov\">Otkodov</a> to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/378YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#Thunder_in_the_Silver_Peaks\" title=\"378YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">invade the Silver Peaks</a>, in an attempt to create a beachhead into Sermersuaq. Barbarian and Imperial forces were well matched, but the advantage appeared to lie with the Thule as they <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/378YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#Blood_on_the_Stonefields\" title=\"378YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">slowly pushed the defenders back</a>.</p><p>During the Autumn Equinox 378YE, the <b>Battle of Ikka's Tears</b> took place on the cold plains east of the glacier. The Thule had sent a large force of elite warriors, accompanied by a massive warbeast, to steal an artefact of unknown power from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Face_of_Ikka\">Face of Ikka</a>. They were intercepted by a warband of the Empire's heroes using the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sentinel_Gate\" title=\"Sentinel Gate\">Sentinel Gate</a>. This powerful barbarian army inflicted a painful defeat on the Imperial heroes, perhaps the most significant since the death of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Britta\" title=\"Empress Britta\">Empress Britta</a> two years previously.</p><p>In Summer 379YE a delegation of Thule attended the Anvil summit and brokered a peace treaty with the Empire which the Senate <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Accept_Thule_peace_treaty\" title=\"Accept Thule peace treaty\">later accepted</a>. This required the Silver Peaks be ceded to the Thule, in return for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Recent_History\" title=\"Karsk\">land surrendered to the Empire elsewhere</a>. With heavy hearts, the defenders of the northern mountains withdrew and allowed the Thule to take the Stonefield Ice Caves.</p><p>The territory was relatively peaceful until Winter 381YE, when a major force of Jotun champions lead by the Ice Fishers of Ldansk moved into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Stark\">Stark</a> and began <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Winter_Solstice_winds_of_war#Nothing_Will_Hold\" title=\"381YE Winter Solstice winds of war\">making preparations for a major invasion</a>.

They shimmer brightest in the Winter months, visible from the northernmost territories of Wintermark, and Varushka, and from the new demesne of the Imperial Orcs. Beautiful, terrible. They dance like fire, gold, and green, and blue, and red. </p><p>During the coldest winters, they may be seen further south. Coiling, dancing. On nights when they are bright, wise Suaq know not to sleep outside; to lace the tent and urge their Kallavesi and Steinr friends to shutter their windows. Those who sleep under their illumination suffer unsettling dreams; stories say that in time they come to crave the touch of these dancing lights. When Spring comes, denied the light, they are maddened. They turn on themselves, or their brothers and sisters, or they disappear \u2013 last seen walking north, into Sydanjaa or Otkodov seeking some communion with the lights in the night sky. </p><p>Perhaps these are only stories.</p><p>Some Suaq say that their light reveals hidden messages and secret places to those who know how to look. Some Suaq starwatchers say that these nameless lights can be evoked to work magic. They are the law \u201cthings are unknown\u201d - Wyr, or that rune that is nameless, serpentine in the night sky. The dark counterpart of the Key, and the Lock, of the Spider, and the Web. The answer to the riddle \u201cwho hides the stars?\u201d</p>Of course other stories suggest that starwatchers who try to evoke the dancing lights of the north can do so only be determining their name, by understanding what by its nature must remain unknown. They say that Barsai the Sealspeaker learnt the unknown name, and in his moment of understanding was drawn into the night sky and known no more by the Suaq, encompassed ultimately by that which he thought to encompass.</p></div></div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Grave_of_the_Giants\">The Grave of the Giants</span></h3><p>In Tsirku a great ice-cavern lies by the edge of the waters of Nutjuitoq.

This stone however represents a place of truce where <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a> and Winterfolk representatives can meet together without fear of violence. Such meetings are irregular, but do take place - when <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Guntherm\" title=\"Emperor Guntherm\">Emperor Guntherm</a> negotiated a ceasefire with the Jotun leaders, this is where he did it. This place is neutral ground, and neither human nor orc claims it as part of their nation.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"East_Floes\">East Floes</span></h3><p>The two freshwater lakes of the East Floes are called \"<i>Big Sister</i>\" and \"<i>Little Brother</i>\" by the Suaq - but there is little agreement which lake is which. This is the source of some humour among outsiders, and there are several jokes and long stories told around campfires whose punchline is the inability of a traveller to tell the difference between two things so obviously unalike. The lakes are the spawning ground of the Sermer Salmon, a particularly hardy breed of fish favoured in the Empire for its rich taste, and sometimes used as a symbol of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Courage\" title=\"Courage\">Courage</a>. </p><p>On the edge of the southernmost lake lies <b>Wreck</b>. The rib-bones of a gigantic ship of an ancient make jut from the ice here and lie part-submerged under the water. These rib-bones have been covered to make a shelter, and a small settlement has existed around it for as long as anyone can remember. The ship is sometimes credited as being the creation of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ogre\" title=\"Ogre\">giants</a>, or trolls, while others point to the idea that it is not a ship at all - it is too wide and too deep to have travelled down any of the waterways linking the ice floes with the sea.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sealtoq\">Sealtoq</span></h3><p>The most temperate of the Sermersuaq regions, Sealtoq is the site of <b>Atalaq</b>, the largest permanent settlement in Sermersuaq. It lies on the waters of Atkonartoq, and is gathering and resting place for the scattered hunters who follow the Suaq traditions. Built on the shores of the cold lake, there are a large number of long piers and jetties with buildings on them and occasional stilt-homes in the Kallavesi style. It is rich in oils and pelts, a place of cunning and craft, where whale-followers, walrus-herders, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_magical_traditions#Icewalkers\" title=\"Wintermark magical traditions\">Icewalkers</a> and painted hunters return after long treks over the ice.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Silver_Peaks\">Silver Peaks</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hilly, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Otkodov\" title=\"Otkodov\">Otkodov</a><br />The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a> of the silver peaks are known for silver, iron, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Weltsilver\" title=\"Materials\">weltsilver</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Tempest_Jade\" title=\"Materials\">tempest jade</a> and even <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#The_Stonefield_Ice_Caves\">ilium</a>.

The settlement is also a small garrison of Suaq scouts, who keep a careful eye to the west. Some Winterfolk and Navarr refer to the hall here as the \"<i>Last Lantern</i>\", referring to its position as the furthest wayside inn from the heart of the Empire.

                "description": "<p>Miaren is a land of gentle golden woodlands, open steadings, fertile fields, fair winds and the great Navarr city of Seren. It lies on the border between Dawn and the Marches, between Wintermark and the League. </p><p>In the early years of the Empire the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vallorn\" title=\"Vallorn\">vallorn</a> at Miaren was completely destroyed and at the heart of the forest the ruins of the city Seren reclaimed, to be slowly rebuilt. It is now considered the heartland of the Navarr nation, and a symbol of what can be achieved.</p><p>Today Miaren is dotted with carefully tended woodlands, farms, and orchards; only in the north-western region of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren#Goldglades\">Goldglades</a> is there any true forest. With so much open ground to work with, many of Miaren's <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steading\" title=\"Steading\">steadings</a> have expanded in size far beyond the settlements encountered in other Navarr territories. They increasingly have more in common with the towns and villages of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawn</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marches\" title=\"Marches\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Marches</a> than with the steadings of other territories.

The city of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren#Seren\">Seren</a> is well-known as being built among the ruins of the former Terunael city, but the Navarr are careful not to damage <i>any</i> ruins they have found that have withstood the malice of the vallorn. Any farm might have a carefully preserved ruined tower, any orchard might be bounded by a high wall of unfamiliar construction, any well might be surrounded by wind-worn statues from a time long before the Empire. To those not acquainted with the practice, this can give the territory a slightly eerie quality despite its otherwise pastoral beauty.</p><p>Miaren sees a lot of trade - again its central location combines with its proximity to the heartlands of the Empire to see regular merchant caravans from most Imperial nations. It produces a significant amount of the vinum sap used to create <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liao\" title=\"Liao\">liao</a> for example - more than any other territory in the Empire. With the completion of the Blood Red Roads, there has also been a marked increase in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Faraden\" title=\"Faraden\">Faraden</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast\" title=\"The Brass Coast\">Freeborn</a> and even <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Iron_Confederacy\" title=\"Iron Confederacy\">Suranni</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Axos\" title=\"Axos\">Axou</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarcophan_Delves\" title=\"Sarcophan Delves\">Sarcophan</a> visitors eager to purchase fruit, wines, spirits, wood, and other fine quality goods.

Unlike other Navarr territories, conflict here arises not from the threat of the vallorn but either from the internal politics of the Navarr, or from conflicts between stubborn groups of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marcher</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawnish</a> yeofolk brawling across the invisible \"border\" between their two nations.</p><div style=\"float:right; width: 500px;\"><div class=\"box\"><div class=\"box-inner\"><b>The Heartland of Navarr</b><br /><p>Above all, Miaren is civilised and (compared to many other Imperial territories) reasonably peaceful. It would be easy for an outsider to assume that this means the people of Miaren are \"soft\" or that the other Navarr look down on them for their lives free from the threat of vallorn. Nothing could be farther from the truth.</p><p>Firstly, the people of Miaren are no less likely than any other Navarr to join a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Striding\" title=\"Striding\">striding</a>. Indeed, it is a common practice for the youth of Miaren to immediately join a striding as soon as they pass their citizenship, to go out into the world without their parents or family both to do their part in the fight against the vallorn and to develop their identity as an adult. Many return eventually, but just as many remain with one striding or another for decades, or join a steading in some far-flung part of the Empire. Rowdy drunks at an idyllic roadside <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wayhouse\" title=\"Wayhouse\">wayhouse</a> - or the occasional band of greedy bandits - often discover to their cost that the smiling staff all have a decade or more of experience of hard travel and fighting opponents that would make the toughest bandit weep.</p>Secondly, far from disdaining the civilisation of Miaren most Navarr recognise it as what they one day aspire to create in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liathaven\" title=\"Liathaven\">Liathaven</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia\" title=\"Hercynia\">Hercynia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Therunin\" title=\"Therunin\">Therunin</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande\" title=\"Broc\u00e9liande\">Broc\u00e9liande</a> - and perhaps even in distant Emrys, Cavan, and B\u00e9antal Dol (should that even be possible). In a very real sense, Miaren is ultimately what they are fighting for. One day, there will be no more need to fight the vallorn or the orcs, and all of Navarr will be a garden (at least metaphorically). One day, when the vallorn is gone and the orcs are no longer a threat, Navarr will build something new and enduring from the foundation of their ancient past. One day, Miaren may well provide the blueprint for a brighter future - perhaps not only for the Navarr.</div></div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Points_of_Interest\">Points of Interest</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Seren\">Seren</span></h3><p>A fallen city of Terunael, once the heart of a vallorn, Seren has been absolutely transformed. In 22YE, in the early years of the Empire, the vallorn of Miaren was defeated, and the ruins of Seren reclaimed from the forest. In the centuries since, the Navarr have incorporated the ruins of the ancient Terunael city into their own sprawling settlement. It is the largest permanent settlement of the Navarr in the Empire. In contrast to the larger settlements of the other nations, Seren is composed of a number of interlocking steadings, each technically separate to the others, but entwined in an interdependent relationship. When the steadings need to make decisions as a group, a council of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Brand\" title=\"Brand\">brands</a> is formed to discuss the matter and reach a consensus. This model is often reflected in informal arrangements between Navarr groups across the Empire. For the last century at least there has been a general consensus among the brands who oversee Seren, and recent decades of peace and cooperation have seen it grow in population until it has begun to be seen as a city in its own right. While it is no equal to the great urban centres of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a>, in size and population it is easily a match for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold#Meade\" title=\"Mitwold\">Meade</a> or <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#Siroc\" title=\"Madruga\">Siroc</a>.</p><p>A third of the ruins are given over to a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Golden_Trees_of_Seren\" title=\"Golden Trees of Seren\">weirwood forest</a>, and even in the more built-up areas there are many green open spaces and carefully tended trees. Across the Empire, it is often referred to as \"the Garden City\".</p><p>The ruins of Seren have been extensively explored and catalogued, and many of the facts the Empire knows about the Terunael were uncovered here. At the height of Terunael, Seren was a city known for its scholars and poets, and for both colleges and military academies. Several of these buildings were reclaimed when the vallorn fell, and while no writing survived exposure to the heart of corruption, a combination of divination magic and tireless archaeology slowly teased our some of the secrets of the Terunael. </p><p>In early 377YE a number of fortified watchtowers and secure campsites were built around Seren, providing local bandit-hunters and scouts safe places to use in their pursuit both of lawbreakers and opportunistic orc raiding parties. The project was overseen by Henry Ward (senator for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Upwold\" title=\"Upwold\">Upwold</a>) as part of a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_multiple_towns\" title=\"Fortify multiple towns\">larger</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Senate</a> initiative to provide protection to towns throughout the Empire.

The territory is situated in the Great Vale, a bowl of mountains that surround both Hercynia and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a>. It is an inhospitable place, but where the trods flow so the Navarr travel. Over the centuries, the Navarr have made slow but steady inroads here, reclaiming much of the forest from the particularly malicious vallorn that dwells within it.</p><p>The trees of Hercynia are ancient, and the soil of the forests is home to a great wealth of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Dragonbone\" title=\"Materials\">dragonbone</a> which for centuries was carefully harvested and used extensively by the runesmiths in the forges at <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#Treji\">Treji</a>. Spring is short here, and winter long and dark. On the coldest winters, when <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Northern_lights\" title=\"Sermersuaq\">eerie lights</a> dance in the northern sky, snow blankets the dark pines.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>The fall of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a> in 373YE left the people of Hercynia facing immediate danger, as the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> orcs tried to force their way into the forest to achieve the capture of the whole of the Great Vale. Barbarian forces took the runeforges of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#Treji\">Treji</a>, but made no further ground. With the defeat of the Thule forces in Skarsind, it is likely that a concerted effort could be made to recover the territory claimed by the orcs.</p><p>Of particular concern to the people of Hercynia is the idea that concerted push from the orcs could result in the loss of more ground, and (coupled with the presence of the vallorn in Deer's Folly), the loss of the entire territory. Thankfully, the defeat of the Thule in Skarsind made this much less of a possibility. In the Winter of 377YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs_territories#The_Summer_Storm\" title=\"Imperial Orcs territories\">Summer Storm</a> army swept down from the foothills to the north into the Glade of Shadows and shattered the barbarian presence there. The Imperial orcs liberated Treji, and freed hundreds of enslaved Navarr. Now the Imperial Orcs hold Skarsind, and the Navarr are starting to set up trade routes to the new nation.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Treji\">Treji</span></h3><p>A stone-built steading in the heart of the winter forest at <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#The_Glen_of_Shadows\">The Glen of Shadows</a>, and one of the only places where the Navarr had a number of large forges, built with aid from the Winterfolk. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steinr\" title=\"Steinr\">Steinr</a> apprentices are often placed with the Navarri for a time, to learn the working of wood alongside metal. The steading fell to the barbarian orcs in the fall of Skarsind in 372YE and was liberated by the Imperial orcs in the Winter of 377YE. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Keeper_of_the_Memorial_Gardens_of_Treji\" title=\"Keeper of the Memorial Gardens of Treji\">Memoiral Gardens of Treji</a> remember the liberation; a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Herb_garden\" title=\"Herb garden\">herb garden</a> given over to the custody of the Imperial Orcs.</p><p>The forges here were devastated during the fighting and by last-ditch sabotage by the spiteful Thule defenders. Hundreds of Navarr slaves were liberated in the process, including a number of artisans who had been forced to create weapons and armour for their captors. A number of prisoners were unaccounted for, however - many of the runesmiths captured when the steading was taken had already been sent north to captivity in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Otkodov\" title=\"Otkodov\">Otkodov</a>.</p><p>Shortly before Summer 380YE, work was completed on a large wayhouse here designed to encourage trade with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a>, under the control of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broker_of_Treji_Wayhouse\" title=\"Broker of Treji Wayhouse\">Broker of Treji Wayhouse</a>.

It produces 25 Imperial wains of weirwood every season. Control is allocated to any Imperial citizen by open auction during the Winter Solstice.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Blade_of_Thorn\">The Blade of Thorn</span></h3><p>The Blade of Thorn was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Commission\" title=\"Commission\">commissioned</a> by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Construct_Blade_of_Thorn\" title=\"Construct Blade of Thorn\">order</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> in Spring 382YE and completed shortly before the Summer Solstice of the same year. An intricate knot of paths in the slopes of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#Old_Ranging\">Old Ranging</a>, the Blade of Thorn is shaped by the winding of small rods and banks of heather. Built at the request of Rhisiart Dancewalker it is a site of memorial and pride to those who have given their lives in support of the Empire and whose unnumbered names are carved into stone menhirs that periodically line the earthen slopes. Visitors to the site are encouraged to chisel the names of fallen heroes to the stones by the Blade\u2019s rest wayhouse, used as a hostel by those who maintain the work. Prominent in particular with blood red limestone are the menhirs of those who have fallen for Liathaven including the stridings of Exiles End, Tarw, and Y\u2019basden. The particularly vigilant will perhaps notice the names of Yanto, and Warbeast carved alone on a smaller obsidian stone etched with the rune of Zorech, rumoured to have been taken from the Black Plateau. At the centre of the swirling, curling knot stands a giant black stone with a single name in gold: Achilles of Damakan\u2019s Forge.</p><p>The stones themselves are only a part of the great work. They mark a spiral design worked into the sod of the foothills and reinforced by wandering feet. This grand design subtly alters and focuses the flows of mana from the mountains, and across the entire territory. At key places in each <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Territory#Region\" title=\"Territory\">region</a> a similar design - albeit of much smaller scale - can be found marked out by similar limestone menhirs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Gate_of_Summer\">The Gate of Summer</span></h3><p>Two huge stones and a top lintel stand in the middle of a clearing, carved about with boar, deer and other game, and symbols representing summer. It is covered in moss, and no-one has ever seen a hint of any magic from it. </p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Vallorn_of_Hercynia\">The Vallorn of Hercynia</span></h3><p>The vallorn of Hercynia is often characterized as \"malicious\" or \"patient.\" It does not seem to be as vibrant as the vallorn in more southerly climes, and is certainly not as aggressive as the vallorns of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande\" title=\"Broc\u00e9liande\">Broc\u00e9liande</a> or <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liathaven\" title=\"Liathaven\">Liathaven</a>. It is well known that the Vallorn itself is not sentient but a hostile area of land, however, it is the actions of the creatures that dwell in the Vallorn that give it this reputation.  While incursions from vallornspawn are few and far between, they are especially vicious when they do come. Over the centuries, it has been beaten back to a dark heart in eastern <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#Deer.27s_Folly\">Deer's Folly</a> but efforts to dislodge it entirely have failed.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Northpines\">Northpines</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> Forest, Hills<br />The mountains of north-west Hercynia are home to several mines that have been worked since before there was an Empire. The slopes of the mountains are thick with ancient pine trees, rich in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Ambergelt\" title=\"Materials\">Ambergelt</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Dragonbone\" title=\"Materials\">Dragonbone</a>. This was the easiest region to clear of Vallorn influence during the slow war of attrition to regain Hercynia, and there have been no major incursions of vallornspawn into the mountains in centuries. This region is famously where Myfanwy (one of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr_History\" title=\"Navarr History\" class=\"mw-redirect\">earliest companions</a> of the First Empress) was born, and where she was called to help mediate a dispute between rival steadings during the unsuccessful first attempt to bring the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_history#Joining_the_Empire\" title=\"Urizen history\">Urizen</a> into the Empire. Some conspirators claim that had Myfanwy made the trip with the First Empress, the Urizen could have been convinced to join the Empire early.</p><p>Several secluded passes through the mountains into Skarsind served as trade routes prior to the invasion of the Thule. In later years they were used to launch scouting missions into the barbarian-held territory. The steadings of the region are considered a little odd by many Navarr, and occasionally accused of having more in common with the Winterfolk than with their own cousins. There may be a little truth to this - with the loss of the Glen of Shadows to the barbarians, Northpines was cut off from the rest of Hercynia - and indeed the Empire - by a combination of barbarians and the vallorn-infested region of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#Deer.27s_Folly\">Deer's Folly</a> to the south.<br /></p><p>North Pines is the home to the Pridestalkers Striding who's rite of passage involves hunting and skinning the Snow Lions, the children of the Eternal Cathan Canae.  It is also the location of the newly built <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Voice_of_Barbs#The_House_of_Barbs\" title=\"Voice of Barbs\">House of Barbs</a>, commissioned by the controversial senator Rhain Winters Vigl.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Glen_of_Shadows\">The Glen of Shadows</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The steading of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#Treji\">Treji</a> still stands here, but has been extensively damaged by the battle between the Imperial orcs and the barbarian occupiers. The artisans who made their home here combined the working of wood and metal to make weapons and armour for the Thorns of Hercynia and to support their Winterfolk allies. The Iron Roots of Treji stand guard in this area to make sure that no threat will harm the area. The Glen of Shadows is known for their fine magical bows and spears, easily matching the more workmanlike produce of the Wintermark runesmiths. </p><p>The famous <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Shadowglyn_Distillery\" title=\"Shadowglyn Distillery\">Shadowglyn Distillery</a> is located here on the lower slopes of the Northpines. The once famous distillery produced some of the best drinks in the Empire until it was destroyed in a pitched battle between the Thule and Navarr defenders, during fighting in the territory.  Production has recently restarted at the site, under the auspices of Wern Taur Thorntarry.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Deer.27s_Folly\">Deer's Folly</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> Forest, Hills, Vallorn<br />Another mountainous area of Hercynia, but one that has fared less well than Northpines. While the mountains to the west create a natural barrier against the worst effects of the vallorn, a poisonous miasma lies over much of the region. The noxious atmosphere pools in valleys and spreads through the forest from the vallorn of Hercynia, wrapped tight around the ruins of an ancient Terunael city in the east. There are only a handful of steadings in Deer's Folly and they are all built in the western mountains - no steading established closer to the vallorn heart has survived more than a decade before it is overrun.  The oldest of these is the small but ancient steading of Bont Goch. The Winterfolk Queen Ilsin is believed to have met her end here at the hands of the Vallornspawn - some scholars point to the fact that her famous standard bore a white stag and suggest it is more than coincidence the region is known as \"Deer's Folly\" - but if it had a name before this it is known only to historians. (<b>OOC Note:</b> This region is not considered to be in Imperial hands. It cannot be reclaimed until the power of the vallorn is broken.)</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Old_Ranging\">Old Ranging</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The forests of Old Ranging are carefully cultivated by the inhabitants of the Steadings here. The woods are rich with animal life, and many hunters make a good living providing pelts, furs and fine meats to merchants and traders who travel across the Empire. Likewise, the many streams and shallow rivers are rich with an impressive variety of fish and a number of steadings here raise domesticated deer and even goats whose meat is very much in demand. There are several well-established trade routes from Old Ranging to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark#Kalpaheim\" title=\"Hahnmark\">Kalapheim</a> and Winterfolk merchants are a common sight in the Summer months. It has not always been this way of course - there are several battlefields here that date back to pre-Imperial times when the ancestors of the modern Winterfolk, spurred on by their <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_history\" title=\"Wintermark history\">successes against the trolls</a> attempted to conquer Hercynia. The tragic tale of Queen Ilsin is sometimes told by both Navarr and Winterfolk, recounting how her army was lead through Old Ranging by the clever Navarr and tricked into marching into Deer's Folly where the 'thousand strong army' was devoured by the vallorn. The tale is probably an exaggeration but seems to have at least some basis in truth. It marked the last major conflict between the Navarr and the Winterfolk in Hercynia, although to this day Suaq explorers make occasional forays into Old Ranging seeking for some sign of Queen Ilsin's personal standard <i>Winter Fury</i> which is believed to be a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thaneshall_Banner\" title=\"Thaneshall Banner\">potent artefact</a>.</p><p>In recent years, as the heart of the Vallorn of Hercynia has become more restive, there has been an increase in vallornspawn attacks on hunting parties along the northern borders - but never in great numbers, and the attacks have been dealt with swiftly and effectively by vigilant Thorns.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summersend\">Summersend</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The forests of Summersend are sparse, giving way to the plains of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Gildenheim\" title=\"Skarsind\">Gildenheim</a> to the north. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#The_Gate_of_Summer\">Gate of Summer</a> is found here, along with several other well-explored Terunael ruins. Several steadings are built on a foundation of old Terunael structures, and it is from here that the push to drive back the Vallorn is overseen. There are several old battlefields here, most dating back to pre-Imperial times and to attempts by the Vard ancestors of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushkans</a> to conquer Hercynia. Most of these battlefields have long since been forgotten but one - <b>Mourning Hollow</b> on the very south-eastern borders - <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rubies_on_the_Snow\" title=\"Rubies on the Snow\">was said to be haunted</a> by the unquiet spirits of dead Vard and Navarr warriors due to the result of a forgotten curse or betrayal.  Due to the actions of an expedition in Winter 379YE there have been no sightings of ghosts since. Mourning Hollow is also the site of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_Library_of_Hacynian\" title=\"Great Library of Hacynian\">Great Library of Hacynian</a>.</p><p>In addition to the usual occasional incursions from the vallorn of Hercynia, there have been several skirmishes with the orcs both from Skarsind and from the Glen of Shadows to the north-west. The fortified steadings here served as a base of operations for forays into Skarsind during the recent war, and a number of Wintermark refugees were helped to safe havens in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark\" title=\"Hahnmark\">Hahnmark</a> to the south-west.</p><p>The Foxden steading is the most influential steading based in Summersend and acts as a place to run messages not only across Hercynia but across the entire Empire.</p><p>Summersend is also the site of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Heartwood_of_the_Great_Vale\" title=\"Heartwood of the Great Vale\">Heartwood of the Great Vale</a>, and of the corpse glade where the eerie unknown remains dug from beneath the roots of the ancient weirwood are interred.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#Heartwood_of_the_Great_Vale\">Heartwood of the Great Vale</a> is in northern Summersend, right on the edge of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hercynia#The_Glen_of_Shadows\">Glen of Shadows</a>.</p><div style=\"float: right; width=300px; margin-right:10px; margin-left: 10px; clear: right;\"><table><tr><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Summit</th><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Elected</th></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 382YE</td><td>Rhisiart Dancewalker</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 381YE</td><td>Rhisiart Dancewalker</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 380YE</td><td>Ranulf Pridestalker</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 379YE</td><td>Ranulf Pridestalker</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 378YE</td><td>Rhain</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 377YE</td><td>Rhain</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 377YE</td><td>Rhain</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 376YE</td><td>Cei Windstrider</td></tr></table></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_Senate_Elections\">Recent Senate Elections</span></h2><p>As an Imperial territory, Hercynia is represented by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> elected in the Winter.

Some have collapsed, and others are now submerged or exposed as the waters of the massive freshwater lake have ebbed and flowed. The docks date back to the time of Terunael, and have been thoroughly explored by the modern Navarr; they seem to be much larger than would be appropriate for fishing the Feverwater, and the ruins around the area are certainly those of a reasonably large Terunael settlement. Their purpose remains a mystery - all that lies to the east of Therunin are the dark woodland homes of the Druj.

The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_Lower_Tarn_Valley_II\" title=\"Fortify Lower Tarn Valley II\">commission</a> was beset by challenges but work was completed shortly before the Winter Solstice 383YE. A series of majestic weirwood towers surrounded by a wall topped with living thorns, the beautiful and imposing fortification is also <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_place_you_called_home#The_Holt_of_the_Oak\" title=\"The place you called home\">garrisoned</a> by orc warriors - meaning that the Empire does not need to pay for its upkeep. Navarr and Great Forest orcs alike mix freely in the shadow of the towers, and traders from other Imperial nations - with the notable exception of the Dawnish - have found it to be an excellent place to meet and do business with the otherwise standoffish orcs.</p><p>If the treaty with the orcs were broken and the Great Forest orcs were motivated to try and seize the Lower Tarn Valley then the fortification would take no part in the initial fighting. If this were to happen, and the orcs were to consolidate their control of the region, then the fortification could provide full support to an effort they made to conquer the territory or resist Imperial forces.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"East_Ashes\">East Ashes</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Marsh<br />Stretching along the shores of the Feverwater, East Ashes is a twisted maze of great mangrove trees and murky water. Like the Tarn Valley it is home to several rare creatures, but the smaller beasts are overshadowed by the occasional incursion by a pack of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Legendary_beasts#Hydra\" title=\"Legendary beasts\">hydra</a>. Even the threat of the hydra is minor compared to the danger caused by the occasional <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marshwalkers\" title=\"Marshwalkers\">marshwalkers</a> attempting to migrate through East Ashes toward the Lower Tarn Valley - when they pass through Greenheart, they invariably rouse the insects there and emerge on the far side angry and twisted by the poisonous air of the vallorn.The Steading of Ruis Farkas is based in East Ashes.  Since the death of Empress Britta, this small steading has been highly politically active in the Empire to ensure that Britta's successor has a strong Empire to lead <br /><br />This region has a reputation for being haunted; the core of that reputation can be traced to <b>Fever\u2019s Wake</b>. Once a Navarri Glade of the Dead, but over a small space of days all the corpses laid there disappeared completely, with no sign they had ever existed. The area is shunned completely now.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eastring\">Eastring</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The ground in Eastring is less marshy than that of the Lower Tarn Valley or East Ashes, but there are several expanses of bayou especially in the west or south. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Iridescent_Butterfly\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">iridescent butterfly</a> is extremely common here, and the forests are rich in hard and softwoods making lumber a regular export. Eastring is also home to several fortified steadings, and a higher than average concentration of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thorn\" title=\"Thorn\">Thorns</a> due to the constant threat posed by the barbarian lands to east and north. This was one of the first regions of Therunin cleared of vallorn influence, and is the site of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thimble\" title=\"Thimble\">the Thimble</a>, a valuable source of weirwood.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Greenheart\">Greenheart</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> Forest, Vallorn<br />The vallorn holds the ruins at the centre of Therunin in a fierce grip. While other Navarr forests are generally more threatened by vine-infested husks, the monstrous insects of Greenheart greatly outnumber the unliving corpses. The ruins themselves are water-logged, with large sections submerged in marsh according to the few adventurous scouts who have penetrated into this deadly zone.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lower_Tarn_Valley\">Lower Tarn Valley</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Marsh, Great Forest Orcs<br />The lower valley is boggy and marshy. It is known as an excellent location for herb gathering, and the steadings here tend to have large numbers of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Herb_garden\" title=\"Herb garden\">herb gardens</a>. The Lower Tarn Valley teems with rare wildlife seen nowhere else in the Empire - the delicate and deadly red crane, the somnolent bark alligator and the morose blue wave frog.</p><p>The Lower Tarn Valley is the centre of habitation for the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_Forest_Orcs\" title=\"Great Forest Orcs\">Great Forest</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a>. They do not control the region - it is still part of the Empire - but there is a sizeable population of orcs here living alongside their Navarr hosts. A small community of non-Imperial humans, all of whom are said to possess the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Briar\" title=\"Briar\">briar</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lineage\" title=\"Lineage\">lineage</a> live with the Great Forest orcs, and are closely allied with them. While orcs from the Great Forest can be found across Therunin - and indeed the Empire since some of them began walking the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trods\" title=\"Trods\" class=\"mw-redirect\">trods</a> - the heart of their community has been in the Lower Tarn Valley since they arrived. The orcs maintain and garrison the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Therunin#Holt_of_the_Oak\">Holt of the Oak</a> here - a unique <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> that protects the Lower Tarn Valley - and the whole of Therunin - from enemy invasion.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Peakedge_Song\">Peakedge Song</span></h3><p>Comparatively lightly wooded, especially for a Navarr forest, the steadings of Peakedge Song maintain cordial relations with their neighbours to the north and south. The land here slopes quickly into the foothills of Morrow, and there are several valuable mines along the southern border. During the fall of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#High_Chalcis\" title=\"Reikos\">High Chalcis</a> the Navarr lead several rescue missions across the borders, and as a consequence a number of Highborn refugees camped there; with the final liberation of Reikos, many of them have chosen to return - but a significant number have chosen to remain as permanent residents of the steading. At the same time, a number of Navarr have chosen to move to Reikos - initially to help in the establishment of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Gardens_of_High_Chalcis\" title=\"Gardens of High Chalcis\">Gardens of High Chalcis</a>, but they have also established a small settlement on the edge of the forest not far from Peakedge Stead.</p><p>One of the most important sites in Therunin, <b>Peakedge Stead</b> is found in the western part of the territory. A place of contemplation, of houses in the trees where the Navarr can see across the hills of Reikos to the forests beyond. Some stories claim the steading is a remnant of long-lost Terunael; there is something ageless about the trees here.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sweetglades\">Sweetglades</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> Forest, Vallorn<br />The forests of the Sweetglades are ironically named; the vallorn holds sway here.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Upper_Tarn_Valley\">Upper Tarn Valley</span></h3><p>Looking down on the Lower Tarn Valley, the Upper Valley is comparatively dry but the soil here is rich and healthy. The steadings here take advantage of this fertility, and the relative dearth of trees, to maintain extensive agriculture. The largest steading in the Upper Tarn Valley is <b>Return</b>, a well-fortified settlement surrounded by tall watchtowers that look out across the forests to the north and east. A place of flowers and memory, the steading has a storied history, revolving around the tale of a Brand who spent too much time amongst the barbarians and became too much like them - where Stridings pass to remember what happens when you forget that you are human, and they are not.</p><div style=\"float: right; width=300px; margin-right:10px; margin-left: 10px; clear: right;\"><table><tr><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Summit</th><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Elected</th></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 383YE</td><td>Cybi Farkas</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 382YE</td><td>Cybi Farkas</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 381YE</td><td>Cybi Farkas</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 380YE</td><td>Willa Farkas-Vigil</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 380YE</td><td>Caerwyn Summer Crow</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 379YE</td><td>Caerwyn Summer Crow</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 378YE</td><td>Caerwyn Summer Crow</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 377YE</td><td>Caerwyn Summer Crow</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 376YE</td><td>Caerwyn Summer Crow</td></tr></table></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_Senate_Elections\">Recent Senate Elections</span></h2><p>As an Imperial territory, Therunin is represented by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> elected in the Autumn.

The First Dance steading are based in the Broch and seek more than any to investigate new ways to fight against the Vallorn.

Even in the time of Terunael, the forest was old. There are immense trees in parts of Liathaven that are believed to be thousands of years old, and parts of the forest that even today have seen only a handful of humans pass through them. Liathaven itself is only a spur of a much larger forest that stretches hundreds of miles to the west; a great wood that served as a natural boundary between the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a> barbarians in the north and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Faraden\" title=\"Faraden\">Faraden</a> foreigners in the south.</p><p>The wildlife of Liathaven likewise tends to be larger than normal, with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Big_Cats\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">forest lions</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Dire_Beasts\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">dire beasts</a> (especially bears, wolves and stags) being comparatively common compared to other parts of the Empire. The weather in Liathaven is changeable, and the territory is known for its heavy storms and strong winds, caught as it is between the temperate Marches and the warmer Brass Coast to the south.</p><p>Most parts of Liathaven have been well-settled by the Navarr - those few Terunael ruins that have not been incorporated into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steadings\" title=\"Steadings\" class=\"mw-redirect\">steadings</a> have mostly been studied by scholars and archaeologists - but occasionally a hitherto overlooked structure will be found, wreathed in vines or buried under centuries of undergrowth. The richest new ruins are found along the borders of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vallorn\" title=\"Vallorn\">Vallorn</a>-infested regions of Liath's Heart and Westwood, of course.</p><p>Many of the Striding that walk the Trods around Liathaven are composed of some of the more militant members of the nation, who will stop at nothing to recover their homeland from the Jotun.   In Liathaven the <i>Duskbourne Striding</i> have traveled from around the Empire to reclaim Liathaven to make it their new home.  The <i>Pathfinder Striding</i> sold on all their goods to fund the military units that they use to support the Liathaven resistance.  Many of the Stridings in Liathaven  such as the <i>Y'Basden</i>, the <i>Companions of Tarw</i> and the <i>Keepers of the Way</i> have formed the <i>Black Scar</i>, who spend most of their time organising the resistance to the Jotun in the region.  <i>Y'Basden</i> in particular have been active in the defense of the remaining Navarr.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>The Jotun began their invasion of Liathaven in the autumn of 346YE, taking advantage of the eastern-focus of the Imperial armies under the domination of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Giselle\" title=\"Empress Giselle\">Empress Giselle</a>. They pressed ever eastwards, avoiding the vallorn and seizing many Navarri steadings.

Today, apart from regular raiding bands attacking the Marchers and the occasional forays through the mountains into Kahraman, Liathaven seems quiet - almost peaceful. Despite a slight rise in encounters with vallornspawn, the pessimistic predictions that the Jotun would 'awaken' the Vallorn in Liathaven and cause widespread doom in the territory has so far failed to come true.</p><p>With a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Accept_Jotun_ceasefire\" title=\"Accept Jotun ceasefire\">ceasefire</a> agreed with the Jotun by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> in Summer 377YE, there have been no further attempts to reclaim Liathaven.  When the Empire broke the ceasefire early in Autumn 378YE the armies of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast\" title=\"The Brass Coast\">the Brass Coast</a> tried to take Liathaven, but the Jotun attacked with seven armies taking all of the territory that was not controlled by the Vallorn. Jotun and Imperial forces fought back and forth across the territory for several years, until the orcs eventually withdrew in 381YE.</p><p>In 382YE, as the Jotun withdrew completely, the vallorn <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Root_hog,_or_die\" title=\"Root hog, or die\">began to expand</a>.

It was a regular place of pilgrimage for Navarr practitioners of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way\" title=\"The Way\">Way</a>, and a centre for philosophical thought combining the philosophy of the Great Dance with the Virtues. The fact that it is now in the hands of the Jotun barbarians marks a terrible loss for the Navarr and perhaps the Empire.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Paths_of_Lan_Th.C3.BAven\">The Paths of Lan Th\u00faven</span></h3><p>In <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liathaven#Western_Scout\" title=\"Liathaven\">Western Scout</a>, on the very edge of the vallorn miasma,stand the crumbling pillars of an old gateway. The Gate of Lan Th\u00faven dates back to pre-Imperial times; it may even be Terunael in origin. No stories remain to say who, or what, or where Lan Th\u00faven might have been. Only the gate remains - this one, and a second gate in West Ranging on the far side of Liathaven. Between them, according to refugees from the Jotun-burnt Hidden Walk <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steading\" title=\"Steading\">steading</a>, there is a path through the vallorn. A hidden way, following the route of an old Terunael road, woven with  potent <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Night_magic\" title=\"Night magic\">Night magic</a> that blinds the eyes of the vallornspawn. The insular Hidden Walk used this route to travel deep into the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liathaven#Westwood\" title=\"Liathaven\">Westwood</a>, and to keep contact with their cousins on the other side of Liathaven at Silent Stand steading. The Jotun seized both Hidden Walk and Silent Stand. The steadings were destroyed - but the gates that mark either end of the hidden path still stand. The orcs clearly realised that the gates were valuable, but treated them with the same superstitious dread they show towards anything associated with the vallorn. </p><p>The Empire <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/A_banner_of_Thorns#The_Paths_of_Lan_Th.C3.BAven\" title=\"A banner of Thorns\">recaptured</a> the Paths in Summer 380YE, but as of Summer 383YE they are no more.

The beacons are simple but effective - basic messages could be sent quickly to stations in the mountains of neighbouring Kahraman, and relayed back to Liaven's Glen. In this way, the southern regions of Liathaven stayed in contact with the northern regions despite the Vallorn between them, and the presence of some bloodthirsty clans of bandit orcs in the mountains to the south. Today, Beacon Point maintains a single very unreliable trade route through the mountains to Kahraman. Travelers and caravans alike are in constant danger from the vicious peak orcs, and communication with the defenders is very patchy as a result. This has made the plight of the Beacon Point steadings more desperate - their resources are stretched even further by the need to support the steadings of Western Scout.</p><p>In Winter 379YE a large force of Jotun troops took Beacon Point as part of the Jotun \"rage\" that swept across southern Liathaven. Over the next few years the region changed hands several times. Almost the entire remaining Navarr population either fled through the mountains to Kahraman, or fell to the wrath of the Jotun.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Liath.27s_Heart\">Liath's Heart</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> Forest, Vallorn<br />Forced out of the surrounding regions, the Vallorn has grown powerful in Liath's Heart. It is wrapped tight around the ruins of <i>Liath Haven</i>, squatting at the centre of a miasmic cloud of poison. There are no Navarr steadings in Liath's Heart. Although occasional forays into the region from Liaven's Glen to the east returned triumphant with some fragment of lore or lost treasure, the most accessible ruins have long since been explored or destroyed by rampaging Vallornspawn. With the Jotun in northern Liathaven, the Vallorn is said to be stirring fitfully in its slumber - but there have been no signs to date that the Jotun are making any particular effort to 'conquer' it. </p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Liath.27s_Ring\">Liath's Ring</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />Near the eastern border of Liath's Ring stands <b>Mournstead</b>, a stout steading - the last redoubt of the Navarr in Liathaven to fall to the barbarians. The region was known both for sprawling groves of beggarwood trees, and for the occasional standing stone or dolmen in out-of-the-way places. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marcher</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Landskeeper\" title=\"Landskeeper\">Landskeepers</a> - especially those from nearby <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bregasland\" title=\"Bregasland\">Bregasland</a> were regular visitors to this part of the forest, and its eerie monoliths.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Liaven.27s_Glen\">Liaven's Glen</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />This area of eastern Liathaven was the first area of Liathaven freed of Vallorn influence some two hundred years before the foundation of the Empire. According to some records, the network of trails and earthworks known as <b>Liaven's Dance</b> was a prototype working designed to weaken the power of the vallorn, eventually culminating in the vast web of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trods\" title=\"Trods\" class=\"mw-redirect\">trods</a> that now criss-cross the Empire. Several steadings here were home to experienced <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Coven\" title=\"Coven\" class=\"mw-redirect\">covens</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr_magical_traditions#Vates\" title=\"Navarr magical traditions\">vates</a> who oversaw potent <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mana_site\" title=\"Mana site\">mana sites</a> and studied the vallorn along the edges of Liath's Heart to the south-west. Many of these vates were killed fighting to protect their homes from the orcs, but some managed to flee into exile.   The <i>Dancewalker Striding</i> was formed of members of the steadings at the Dance who swore to walk the trods here until Liathaven was back under Imperial Control.</p><p>Of particular note is the library at <b>Turning Spiral</b>. This old steading held a repository of Navarr magical lore that survived the purges of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Nicovar\" title=\"Emperor Nicovar\">Emperor Nicovar</a> comparatively unscathed. Tragically, its own defenders were forced to destroy it rather than let it fall into barbarian hands. While some of the books were carried to safety by fleeing vates, many hundreds more were incinerated in magically-fuelled fire as the entire steading was transformed into a conflagration by the defenders (a conflagration that claimed not only their lives, but the lives of at least two hundred orcs). Some of the last vates to leave Turning Spiral never reached the safety of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman#Serra_Briate\" title=\"Kahraman\">Serra Briante</a> to the south - at least two groups are known to have set off but disappeared somewhere in the mountains between Liathaven and Kahraman.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Westwood\">Westwood</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> Forest<br />The tainted vegetation of the Vallorn once spilled westward into this region from Liath's Heart. There were a few steadings here, but they have been abandoned due to the twin threats of the vallornspawn and the Jotun barbarians raiding from the west and north. The last steading abandoned to the vallorn was that of <b>Duskwater Tarry</b>, a steading built on raised platforms in the centre of a freshwater lake that protected a dangerous direct trade route between Western Scout and West Ranging. The inhabitants withdrew south in 352YE and it is believed that the Vallorn swiftly swallowed it up as it had other abandoned settlements. The entire region belonged to the Vallorn. In recent times the Vallorn tried to expand into West Ranging. It was rebuffed, and in Summer 383YE Imperial forces took <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/383YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#Blood_for_poppies\" title=\"383YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">advantage of its weakened state</a> to clear the Vallorn from the region, confining it to Liath's Heart</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"West_Ranging\">West Ranging</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Burnt<br />The forests here were reasonably well defended, but the slow drain of Thorns to the battles in the eastern Empire created a weakness the Jotun were quick to exploit. Before the barbarians came, West Ranging was known both for producing fine leather goods and for the Navarr scouts who would regularly slip out of the Empire to spy on - and occasionally raid - the Jotun stockades in the western forests.</p><p>In Winter 381YE, the vallorn <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Root_hog,_or_die\" title=\"Root hog, or die\">began to expand</a> into West Ranging. The Navarr army of the Quiet Step, supported by the Marcher Tusks and Bounders, moved to prevent the expansion. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/382YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Immolation_.28Liathaven.29\" title=\"382YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">fighting was savage</a>, but in the end Imperial forces were victorious. During the campaign, the Quiet Step were aided by a potent <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Enchantment\" title=\"Enchantment\">enchantment</a>, a gift of the eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Thrice-cursed_Court#Surut\" title=\"The Thrice-cursed Court\">Surut</a>, that brought his irresistible fire to bear on the forest and the vallorn. As a consequence, swathes of the once rich woodlands here were reduced to a cold, grey ash where nothing will grow. The fire was particularly keen to consume <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> connected to the Spring realm - which are also key targets for vallornspawn. As such there are almost no Spring regio remaining in West Ranging.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Western_Scout\">Western Scout</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The steadings of Western Scout still hold out against the Jotun, but there have been several serious assaults from the forests west of the Empire. In the last few years these attacks have slackened off, but until 377YE there were still occasional raids by Jotun warbands. The Jotun ceasefire has given these steadings a much-needed breathing space. In addition to the Jotun, there are problems with groups of Vallornspawn that occasionally boil out of the infested regions to the north. The westernmost steadings are in tatters; several have been razed by raiders, while the easternmost steadings are barely in a better state. They survive partly due to the efforts of their hunters but also due to vital supplies from Beacon Point - supplies the eastern steadings can hardly spare themselves, given the problems of maintaining a safe route through the mountains to Kahraman.In Winter 379YE a large force of Jotun troops took Western Scout.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"OOC_Note\">OOC Note</span></h2><ul><li> As of the Summer Solstice 383YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a> orcs control Liath's Ring,  Liaven's Glen, Western Scout and Beacon Point.

Given over now to a great park, and almost completely engulfed in rose bushes, the Castle of Thorns serves as an academy for the training of civil servants, and is where most of the day-to-day business of running the Nation takes place. Each Dawnish Senator has apartments within this beautiful edifice, decorated with the produce and images of the territory they represent.</p><p>According to legends, the roses that enshroud the castle of thorns are the remnants of a magical defence created in pre-Imperial times by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Earl#Enchanter\" title=\"Earl\">enchanter</a> Queen Jessamy. When the castle was besieged, she wove a great thicket of magically strengthened roses that surrounded the castle and tore the attacking forces to pieces when they tried to press the siege. The thicket lasted for only a season, but bought time for Jessamy's husband and allies to rally and come to her defence. The roses of the castle of Thorns are highly prized to this day as a symbol of enduring love and loyalty.</p><p>The River of Sighs runs past the Castle of Thorns. This wide, deep, fast flowing river was the site of the First Empress' legendary leap that won her entry to the house of Cevise. Traditionally set as a challenge for yeomen who were considered to be seeking to rise above their station, there are still knights-errant today who try to duplicate the Empress' jump, and the majority of those who fail are swept away and drowned.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Harps_of_Astolat\">The Harps of Astolat</span></h3><p>The glorious tales of the great victories of 381YE in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Weirwater\" title=\"Weirwater\">Weirwater</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm\" title=\"Semmerholm\">Semmerholm</a> inspired the people of Astolat no less than they inspired their neighbours.

In the end they recognised that the witches already supporting the armies were more than a match for the Druj sorcerers - but they needed a ready source of power to wield their magic on the battlefield, or to weave the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Enchantment\" title=\"Enchantment\">enchantments</a> that will help the knights achieve victory.

                "description": "<p>The craggy hills of Weirwater are home of many weavers, and the noble houses here seem to have more than their fair share of witches. The territory itself is scattered with deep forests, maintained untouched by the noble houses and inhabited by Eternal Heralds, exotic beasts and an abundance of rare herbs. The caves of Weirwater have a dark reputation with the people of Dawn, and are said to contain mysterious magics.</p><p>Legend has it that long ago the Earl of Sedaret pursued a crusade against several cabals of weavers who refused to recognise her authority. At the height of a great banquet, thrown by the Earl to celebrate her apparent victory over the weavers, a great bell began to toll and the castle and its surrounding village was drowned beneath great waves and unrelenting rain. It is said by the people of Culwich that on Winter nights of the new moon when the sky is clear one can still hear bells ringing in the depths of the great lake, and see lights that are said to be those of the drowned Earl and her noble household, still celebrating in the depths.</p><p>During the reign of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Varkula\" title=\"Empress Varkula\">Empress Varkula</a>, a significant force of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> crossed <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Semmerlak\" title=\"The Semmerlak\">the Semmerlak</a> from the east and invaded Weirwater. Fighting under the banner of the Shadow Wasp, the Druj invaded Weirwater with a flotilla of great rafts launched across the Semmerlak. The Druj were lead by a powerful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj#Ghulai\" title=\"Druj\">Ghulai</a> and her <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bands#Covens\" title=\"Bands\">coven</a>, who wielded the power of Spring magic against the Imperial defenders. With the aid of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> - especially <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Megan_Black_Blood\" title=\"Megan Black Blood\">Megan Black Blood</a> - the Druj were defeated - but not before they <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thunderous_Tread_of_the_Trees\" title=\"Thunderous Tread of the Trees\">raised the oldest forests of Weirwater</a> against the Empire. Since then, there has been no significant incursion across the Semmerlak ... but the folk of Weirwater remember.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Culwich\">Culwich</span></h3><p>A large town with a few outlying villages. Culwich has a long tradition of farming and is said to produce some of the best flax and wool in the Empire. The local merchants have influence with the weavers, who in turn offer them fine woven goods to sell to mutual profit. It was here or hereabouts that the first humans to live in Dawn landed. Culwich is now a rich port: goods and trade come to Dawn from Varushka through Culwich. There\u2019s some trade to far-off Highguard, though to get there ships have to pass the shores of the Barrens. </p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Applefell\">Applefell</span></h3><p>A sprawling hill town in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Weirwater#Garthmoor\">Garthmoor</a>, surrounded by small farms. The people have a reputation for standoffishness, even with the merchants who pass through on their way to and from Karov and Semmerholm. While the area is known for its apple orchards, it is also known for \u201c ground apples\u201d - a type of mushroom with an almost spherical head - which can be quite dangerous to those who mistake them for wholesome fungus. They grow on the ground, in rings, and the wise do not consume them without great care. Rumour has is that those who know the trick to preparing them can see into the Labyrinth, converse with ghosts, and perhaps more importantly avoid a lingering death.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Weirwater_Vales\">The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Weirwater_Vales\" title=\"Weirwater Vales\">Weirwater Vales</a></span></h3><p>The Weirwater Vales are a Bourse resource located in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Weirwater#Wickmoor\">Wickmoor</a>.

The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Earl\" title=\"Earl\">earls</a> of Spiral Castle have always been <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Earl#Enchanter\" title=\"Earl\">enchanters</a>, and usually possessed of a strong <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Changeling\" title=\"Changeling\">changeling</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lineage\" title=\"Lineage\">lineage</a>.

Some members of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Imperial Synod</a> have even expressed concerns over whether they are entirely human any more. </p><p>During the height of the Sun Queen's reign, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> agreed to a request that the resources of Spiral Castle be dedicated to the support and upkeep of the armies of the Empire, and of Dawn in particular.

Attempts to communicate with, or reach, the inhabitants of Spiral Castle proved unsuccessful.

The nation, whose name is now lost to antiquity, were exterminated during the war of conquest, finally forced back to their stronghold in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Ulvenholm\">Ulvenholm</a> and destroyed after a terrible siege.</p><p>It was from Semmerholm that the Dawnish planned their campaign against the burghers of pre-<a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">League</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg\" title=\"Holberg\">Holberg</a>, who engaged in a variety of innovative and underhand strategies to keep the Imperial forces off-balance as well as launching regular attacks into Dawnish territory. In the centuries since, relations between the people of Holberg and those of Semmerholm have mellowed extensively - prior to the invasion of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> a great deal of trade passed through the great stone <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#The_Gate\">Gate</a> set into the southwestern peaks.</p><p>Semmerholm produces a major share of the nation's food, for all that it is closely surrounded by thick and dangerous forests. The dark woodlands are home to vicious beasts, including boars, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Big_Cats\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">lions</a> and bears as well as several species of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Drakes\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">drake</a> and a few rare <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Dire_Beasts\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">dire beasts</a>. Hunting is a regular pastime for nobles and yeomen alike, and helps encourage a perception of the people of Semmerholm as being a little \"wilder\" than the average Dawnishfolk. </p><p>There are several well-built castles here at various strategic points along the border, protecting Semmerholm from the barbarians of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Barrens\" title=\"The Barrens\">The Barrens</a> and Holberg. The people for Semmerholm have long felt responsible for holding the borders against the savage tide and this responsibility tends to weigh particularly heavily on the head of the Semmerholm senator. If they fail at their task, this will be the first land lost to the barbarians in Dawnish history.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Immediately after the fall of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg\" title=\"Holberg\">Holberg</a> in 346YE, coupled with renewed barbarian activity in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Barrens\" title=\"The Barrens\">The Barrens</a>, many Dawnish Earls were convinced a major offensive against Semmerholm was in the offing. Apart from a few speculative attacks against <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Estcastle\">Estcastle</a> and the occasional raid into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Estmure\">Estmure</a> the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> appeared unable or unwilling to launch a concerted attack while the city of Holberg proper continues to guard the eastern approach.</p><p>This changed in 373YE when a major offensive against the city was revealed to be a feint to allow four Druj armies to push through into Semmerholm. Estmure was taken and Estcastle besieged, and speculative attacks were made against <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Lacuve\">Lacuve</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Axmure\">Axmure</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Casse\">Casse</a>. The Dawnish armies, already battered from fighting alongside the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">League</a> in Holberg, and woefully undersupplied by the corrupt <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Senate</a> under <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Walter\" title=\"Emperor Walter\">Emperor Walter</a> were able to hold their own but the situation looked critical. A <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a> general by the name of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Britta\" title=\"Empress Britta\">Britta</a> brought her personal forces and a large number of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marcher</a> and Wintermark <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Military_unit\" title=\"Military unit\">soldiers</a> to reinforce the Dawnish. Working under the guidance of General Charles de Gison of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn_military_concerns#The_Eastern_Sky\" title=\"Dawn military concerns\">Eastern Sky</a>, the additional troops bought the battered Dawnish forces chance to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casualties#Resupply\" title=\"Casualties\">resupply</a>. Re-equipped and rested, they launched a devastating counter-attack that drove the Druj back across the border into Holberg but sadly cost the life of General de Gison. Britta's actions during the campaign - and her willingness not to supplant the Dawnish generals in their own campaign - are both credited with being major factors in her later ascension to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Throne\" title=\"The Throne\">Throne</a>, and her practical demonstration of what could be achieved when nations co-operated went a long way to forge the united Empire she left as her legacy.</p><p>Shortly after the Summer Solstice 381YE, a great force of Druj <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#Summer.27s_End_.28Semmerholm.29\" title=\"381YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">swept up from Dawnguard</a> conquering <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Axmure\">Axmure</a> and laying siege to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#The_Gate\">the Gate</a>. The Dawnish armies rallied against the invaders, and with the aid of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Knights_of_Glory\" title=\"Knights of Glory\">Summer realm knights</a> drove the Druj out again by the start of the Spring Equinox 382YE. Some raiding bands, guerillas, and saboteurs still remain in the territory but they are poorly organised and it is likely they will mostly be used as targets for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn_culture_and_customs#The_Test_of_Mettle\" title=\"Dawn culture and customs\">Tests of Mettle</a>.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rucastle\">Rucastle</span></h3><p>First constructed in wood in the early years of Empire; a base for the campaign against the orcs who occupied Semmerholm. It was founded by those strong in the new religion: half church of Virtue, half castle against the orc. Closer to a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapter\" title=\"Chapter\">chapterhouse</a> than fortifications built in Dawn before its foundation, this is a fortress of Empire. It has close ties with the nearby <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steading\" title=\"Steading\">steading</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande#Boar.27s_Dell\" title=\"Broc\u00e9liande\">Greenstead</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande\" title=\"Broc\u00e9liande\">Broc\u00e9liande</a>, which it helped to found. The knights of Rucastle are often called on to help their allies across the border, and there has long been a bond - and several intermarriages - between the two settlements. This close association with the Navarr has lead to the people of Rucastle - and by extension, the citizens of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Elvette\">Elvette</a> - enjoying a reputation as 'fey' or slightly more savage than traditional Dawnish norms.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Pits_of_Brychel\">The Pits of Brychel</span></h3><p>South of castle Arnet, in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Ulvenholm\">Ulvenholm</a>, parts of the earth have fallen away to reveal an underground complex believed to be of Terunael origin. The ruins were stripped of anything of obvious value many years ago, but small bands of scholars still come here from across the Empire to study the remains and the partially buried buildings.</p><p>During the Winter Solstice 381YE a particular strike force raided the Pits of Brychel carrying away a band of scholars studying the old Terunael ruins there. Those witnesses who survived the attack say that the Druj were not alone - that they met with certain bandit bands who had long harassed the people of Ulvenholm and Boar's Dell, descendants of the bitter orcs who once ruled all of Semmerholm. No sign of the raiders or the scholars remained once the Druj were driven out of the territory; the raiders appeared to have taken the bulk of the bandits with them to the relief of the yeofolk and Navarr alike.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Semmer.27s_Rose\">Semmer's Rose</span></h3><p>This beautiful town lies on the shores of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Semmerlak\" title=\"The Semmerlak\">the Semmerlak</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Causse\">Causse</a>. Famous for its spires of white granite and gorgeous shrines to the exemplars and paragons of Dawnish history. It is a meeting place for some of the finest <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Troubadour\" title=\"Troubadour\">troubadours</a> of Dawn, where they share music, legend, and tales of Virtuous <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Glory\" title=\"Glory\">glory</a>. </p><p>The town is built around old citadel from the invasion of Semmerholm, it was here that the Dawnish generals planned and launched their campaigns to conquer the territory. Planned by the legendary siegemaster Willard d'Onnecour, the castle is built of several interlocking concentric circular walls, said to resemble a rose to those who stand on its tallest towers. The famous architect also designed the white granite bridge that spans the river here, said to be a marvel of early Imperial engineering. D'Onnecour himself is buried in the hills above Semmer's Rose in a tomb of his own design. Plans and the occasional rare scroll of his designs and theories are much sought after by masons and architects alike.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Semmerstones\">The Semmerstones</span></h3><p>A cluster of thirty moss-covered white stones on top of a hill in western <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Causse\">Causse</a>, many of them carved with runes thought to date back to the time of Terunael. Each stone is about two feet high and there is no discernible pattern to their layout. The stones have a potent <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> tied to Summer, and are a traditional site for Dawnish <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Earl#Enchanters\" title=\"Earl\">Enchanters</a> to meet with emissaries of the Summer <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eternal\" title=\"Eternal\">eternals</a>. Today, they are watched over by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Weaver\" title=\"Weaver\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Weaver</a> cabal with close ties to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dean_of_the_Lyceum\" title=\"Dean of the Lyceum\">Lyceum</a> who use <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Iridescent_Gloaming\" title=\"Materials\">Iridescent Gloaming</a> gathered in the woods around the base of the stones to produce gorgeous red and blue surcotes and standards.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Golden_Causeway\">The Golden Causeway</span></h3><p>Just outside Lacre in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Lacuve\">Lacuve</a> stands the white granite arch of the Golden Causeway. Completed shortly before the Summer Solstice 382YE, the arch was built as part of an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Opportunity\" title=\"Opportunity\">opportunity</a> provided by the herald known as the Lady of the Semmerlak. Once a servant of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hayaak\" title=\"Hayaak\">Hayaak</a>, this powerful creature is now in the service of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eleonaris\" title=\"Eleonaris\">Eleonaris</a>. The people of Dawn, along with the aid of wise Varushkan allies, not only freed the lady from a grim curse but also provided her with good advice that helped her to quell the turmoil in her heart that had tormented her for centuries; the opportunity to build the causeway came partly in recognition of this heroic effort. </p><p>The two pillars of the gate are marked with mithril sigils, and with the heraldic symbols of both the Dawnish armies, and several houses. The left pillar is surmounted with the moon-and-gryphons of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_noble_houses#House_de_Rondell\" title=\"Prominent noble houses\">House de Rondell</a>, while the right is topped with the fist and moons of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_noble_houses#House_de_Coeurdefer\" title=\"Prominent noble houses\">House de Coeurdefer</a>. Several other prominent houses are celebrated in the pillars of the gate - the devices of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_noble_houses#House_Orzell\" title=\"Prominent noble houses\">Orzel</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_noble_houses#House_Du_Soleil\" title=\"Prominent noble houses\">Du Soleil</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_noble_houses#House_Vexile\" title=\"Prominent noble houses\">Vexille</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_noble_houses#House_Deveraux\" title=\"Prominent noble houses\">Deveraux</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_noble_houses#House_Arwood\" title=\"Prominent noble houses\">Arwood</a> are all clearly visible.</p><p>While built by the Empire, the gate is a gift of the Lady. She seeks a vengeance of her own against the Druj. As such the pillars of the Golden Causeway can be evoked by any Dawnish witch to cause a magical bridge to spring across the Semmerlak from Lacuve to the Druj territory on the other side of the lake. The bridge is wide enough for a dozen soldiers to march abreast, and strong enough to support entire armies. Any Dawnish army can march from Lacuve to the region on the opposite side of the Semmerlak - and return the same way. The causeway does <i>not</i> permit anyone else to use it - in either direction.  It is believed that the Druj will remain unaware of its presence until the Dawnish used it to invade.</p><p>The only potential flaw in the Golden Causeway is that if the eternal the Lady of the Lake serves - currently <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eleonaris\" title=\"Eleonaris\">Eleonaris</a> - were to be placed under <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Amity_and_enmity#Enmity\" title=\"Amity and enmity\">enmity</a> by the Conclave, the causeway could not be called into being until the enmity was lifted.<span id=\"The_Gate\"></span></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Adamant_Gate\">The Adamant Gate</span></h3><p>In <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Estmure\">Estmure</a>, the mountains form a barrier that surrounds Semmerholm. The Gate blocked the widest pass through the mountains with a mighty wall of white granite. A single massive tunnel-entrance opened through the wall, wide enough for two dozen soldiers to march abreast. It was constructed by engineers from Holberg in the early years of the Empire and tales of its courageous defence were told throughout Dawn.<br /><br />Shortly after the Summer Solstice 381YE, the Gate <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#Summer.27s_End_.28Semmerholm.29\" title=\"381YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">fell to a great force of Druj</a> barbarians who swept up from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Barrens#Dawnguard\" title=\"The Barrens\">Dawnguard</a> to lay siege to - and ultimately destroy - the Gate, reducing it to a broken ruin.</p><p>After the Winter Solstice 381YE, a large band of <i>koboldi</i> - heralds of the eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Adamant\" title=\"Adamant\">Adamant</a> - descended on the ruins of the Gate following a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Construct_Gate_in_Semmerholm\" title=\"Construct Gate in Semmerholm\">Senate invitation</a> to rebuild the devastated structure. Using materials provided by merchant prince Lorenzo \u201cLa Volpe\u201d Macelliao von Temeschwar, construction was completed shortly before the Spring Equinox 383YE. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Budded_roses#A_Gate_of_Adamant\" title=\"Budded roses\">According to the <i>koboldi</i></a>, the new structure is \"<i>unbreakable</i>\" - magicians who have examined the finished fortification are excited to discover that while the castle can certainly be damaged it simply cannot be completely destroyed by normal means. It can be captured, certainly, but it would take exceptionally potent magic to actually destroy it - most likely some dire curse of Winter magic to leech the power from the stones.

As Semmerholm slopes down towards Holberg, the peaks of Estmure raise a great barrier against the orcs now occupying the lands to the south-east. There are several small fortresses here, some dating back to pre-Imperial times when the pre-League burghers of Holberg were engaged in economic and literal warfare against the people of Dawn. </p><p>High in the hills here is the tower of <b>Estcastle</b>, which at one time served as a sentinel beacon against the Holbergers but has since been converted to an armed camp that overlooks the tainted plains of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg#Rebeshof\" title=\"Holberg\">Rebeshof</a> and the Druj-haunted forests of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg#Utterlund\" title=\"Holberg\">Utterlund</a>.

The most famous is probably <b>Auvanne</b>. Once famed for its farriers; the finest horseshoes in all of Empire were made here many, many years ago before Semmerholm was even a territory of the Empire. With the passing of the horses, the smiths turned their mastery to armour, and even the runesmiths of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a> acknowledge their craft.</p><p>Overlooking Auvanne is <b>Endric's Hill</b>, a grand barrow mound where the famous Lord Endric and a number of other glorious Dawnish knights lie interred, as well as the site of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Elayne_Silverlark#The_Missing_Tomb\" title=\"Elayne Silverlark\">empty tomb</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Paragons_and_exemplars\" title=\"Paragons and exemplars\">exemplar</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Elayne_Silverlark\" title=\"Elayne Silverlark\">Elayne Silverlark</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lacuve\">Lacuve</span></h3><p>On the shores of Lacuve sits <b>Lacre</b>, a well-defended port known as a place of adventure.

The few who return are f\u00eated and applauded, their names recognised on inn signs throughout the town. Lacre also serves as the closest port to the Barrens, and armies march from its gates to the fortress-settlements to the south.</p><p>In early 377YE a series of squat fortified watchtowers and beacons were constructed around Lacre and along the shore. Following the Winter Solstice 381YE, these towers were largely abandoned and redesigned to create the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Queen%27s_Rose#The_Rose_Towers\" title=\"Queen's Rose\">Rose Towers</a>, a place of pilgrimage celebrating the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawn</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ulvenholm\">Ulvenholm</span></h3><p>Brooding in the light woodlands of Ulvenholm is the ancient fortress of <b>Arnet</b>. The final battles to conquer Semmerholm took place here, on the site of what was once a great fastness of the orcs. The terrible battle that roared around the orc fortress left the woodlands blackened and broken, and when the walls were finally breached the Dawnish knights and their allies swept as an irresistible tide over the leaders of the barbarians. According to legend, the last orc shaman to die laid terrible curses on the attackers, and the credulous whisper that no Earl who has claimed Arnet has died save by violence in all the centuries since. Once the orcs were driven off, the castle was claimed and repaired, extended by Dawnish masons and its white marble towers stand as a monument to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambition\" title=\"Ambition\">Ambition</a> of the Dawnish spirit.

                "description": "<p>The rich heartland of the nation, and the wealthiest territory in terms of timber and amber, this is where most outsiders think of when Varushka is mentioned. The vales here exist among rich forests, where they have not been cleared to make way for small farms. Karov has the largest towns in Varushka, and the majority of its boyars come from this relatively civilised territory. A great deal of trade happens in Karov, with wagon trains and river barges carrying raw materials south to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Temeschwar\" title=\"Temeschwar\">Temeschwar</a> or <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Weirwater\" title=\"Weirwater\">Weirwater</a> and north to more isolated valleys who are in need. </p><p>Despite its settled nature, it would be a mistake to think the land is entirely tamed and great tracts of wilderness still remain, often home to particularly malignant \u2013 if quiescent \u2013 <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushkan_Monsters\" title=\"Varushkan Monsters\" class=\"mw-redirect\">sovereigns</a>. These creatures awaken or emerge from time to time with often tragic consequences - so the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_religious_beliefs\" title=\"Varushka religious beliefs\">wise ones</a> take care to ensure each generation remembers the warning stories about creatures whose last depredations may have been in the times of their grandparents or great-grandparents.</p><p>Karov was one of the first places settled by the Vard during their early conflict with the Ushka. They ruthlessly cleared areas of forests to build their settlements and some of the oldest towns show clear influence of their shared heritage with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steinr\" title=\"Steinr\">Steinr</a> of Wintermark, especially in the west. Indeed, there are several old battlefields in western Karov where Vard and Steinr, and later Varushkan and Wintermark, clashed in the distant past long before the foundation of the Empire. A number of very old tales from Karov include two siblings who romance a stranger; the former represent Vard and Steinr, the latter the Ushka. Invariably the elder sibling wins the affection of the stranger, and the younger angrily retreats to the west. This is a highly stylised and historically dubious version of the founding of Varushka, but it is popular nonetheless.</p><p>On the whole, the folk of Karov enjoy many of the finer things in life - good food, good drink and regular festivals. Many towns and villages in Karov employ <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Stzena\" title=\"Stzena\">Stzena</a>, local musicians who perform at local civic events and celebrations; there are several vales here dedicated specifically to the training of Stzena, and recording and preserving the music and songs of the Varushkan people.-</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Karov is perhaps the most peaceful of the Varushkan territories.

Snow regularly falls here for up to six months in the year, and it is common for vales to be snowed-in during the darkest months - months when <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Northern_lights\" title=\"Sermersuaq\">eerie lights</a> often dance in the sky. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushkan_Monsters\" title=\"Varushkan Monsters\" class=\"mw-redirect\">wolves</a> of Miekarova are especially savage, and every few years or so gather in great hordes that sweep down out of the north, threatening the unwary and causing widespread trouble until they are eventually dealt with. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Plaguewulf\" title=\"Plaguewulf\">Plaguewulfs</a> are more common here than anywhere else in Varushka, and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushkan_Monster#Sovereigns\" title=\"Varushkan Monster\">sovereign</a> believed to be their progenitor, <i>The Howling Queen</i>, is said to slumber somewhere beneath the hills of north-eastern Miekarova.</p><p>Noted for beautiful painted caves beneath several of the larger ranges of hills, it was also the heart of Ushkan mysticism in the dim days long before the foundation of the Empire. It was in Miekarova that the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way\" title=\"The Way\">Imperial Faith</a> found its deepest roots in Varushka, and there are a number of vale here that surround <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Congregation\" title=\"Congregation\">churches and shrines</a> to the Way. The priests here are especially vigilant against the dangers of the dark winters and the monsters that come with it, and several <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Warden\" title=\"Warden\">warden</a> fellowships make a practice of spending their winters here to offer additional assistance.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:ZulganTashTrio.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Deep in the heart of Miekarova lies the Forest of the White Caves, home to the Ushkan-descended Circle of Zulgan-Tash\"><img alt=\"Deep in the heart of Miekarova lies the Forest of the White Caves, home to the Ushkan-descended Circle of Zulgan-Tash\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/8/87/ZulganTashTrio.jpg/350px-ZulganTashTrio.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/8/87/ZulganTashTrio.jpg/525px-ZulganTashTrio.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/8/87/ZulganTashTrio.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">The people of the Forest of White Caves come from ancient stock.</div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mormyk\">Mormyk</span></h3><p>In <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miekarova#Miechernya\">Mierchernya</a>, Mormyk is the furthest western vale and closest to the territory of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a>. It enjoyed a long history of good relations with the people of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind#Estermark\" title=\"Skarsind\">Krysse</a>. Varushkan merchants regularly travelled east to the great market there, while adventurous Winterfolk traders and pedlars were a common feature along the road linking the two. This came to an end with the fall of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> in 373YE. Amid concerns that the barbarians would push east into Miekarova, the people of Mormyk fortified their vale and cast expectant eyes towards the barbarian bastion that the orcs had made amid the halls of Estermark. Now that Skarsind has been assigned to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs\" title=\"Imperial Orcs\">Imperial Orcs</a>, it remains to be seen if the good trading relations between Miekarova and Skarsind can be re-established safely.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Painted_Caves\">The Painted Caves</span></h3><p>Several clusters beautifully painted caves lie under the hills of Miekarova, thought to be of Ushkan origin. The paintings in the cave are incredibly vibrant, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Iridescent_Gloaming\" title=\"Materials\">iridescent gloaming</a> has clearly been added to the pigments. They are often quite abstract, but occasional enigmatic images of people and animals are common features. Several of the caves are known to have potent wards laid over them that still maintain their power today, and more than one contains a strong <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a>, usually connected to the realm of Night.</p><p>The most famous are those in western <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miekarova#Mieriada\">Mieriada</a>; they have been extensively explored and the galleries extend for at least a mile beneath the hills. Many of the paintings here are damaged, either by weapons or by a deliberate attempt to deface them, and historians believe the damage may be the result of an early conflict between Vard and Ushka. Others mutter darkly that the damage here has nothing to do with the Vard, but talk about an internal conflict between the ancient Ushka - they generally claim to have come by this information through visionary dreams, and can provide little proof. Some <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_magical_traditions#Cabalists\" title=\"Varushka magical traditions\">cabalists</a> have claimed that the caves enhance night rituals intended to provide visions, while the famous <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_magical_traditions#Volhov\" title=\"Varushka magical traditions\">volhov</a> Pakaanan claimed that the caves were somehow connected to the enigmatic dreams created with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sift_the_Dreamscape%27s_Sands\" title=\"Sift the Dreamscape's Sands\">Sift the Dreamscape's Sands</a>. Other caves exist under several other peaks</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Razors\">The Razors</span></h3><p>These seven spines of black obsidian stand atop a mountain that shadows the road through <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miekarova#Perumaki\">Perumaki</a>. An outpost at the foot of the mountain observes the razors each morning - they are usually shrouded in cloud as the day dawns, which is a good omen. If the razors are \"unsheathed\" (clearly visible at sunrise), it often signifies that a band of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Plaguewulf\" title=\"Plaguewulf\">plaguewulfs</a> will attack somewhere along the road before the next sunrise. Warning bells are rung, and runners dispatched to nearby vales to warn them of the danger. The razors themselves have never been closely examined - the approach is sheer and the presence of wolves makes it effectively impossible to approach - but study through spyglass has reinforced the belief that several of the ravening beasts that accompany their <i>unsheathing</i> dwell in caves and gulleys around the top of the mountain. Stories say that the <i>Howling Queen</i> rests under the mountain peak, and sometimes gives audience to brave or foolhardy explorers and volhov. The stories further suggest that the mists that generally shroud the razors are nothing other than a massive cloud of corpse-raising venom similar to that produced by the plaguewulfs. They fear what might happen if that malignant fog were to flow down the mountain and into the vales of Perumaki.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Night_Quarry\">The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Night_Quarry\" title=\"Night Quarry\">Night Quarry</a></span></h3><p>The Night Quarry is a Bourse resource located in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miekarova#Mieriada\">Mieriada</a>.

Now renamed the Heart of the Tempest, the woodlands are extremely unwelcoming. In addition to thorny bushes, there are several plant- or plant-like creatures now in residence. Similar to <i>dubik</i> (the blood-hungry plant-like <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushkan_Monster#Wolves\" title=\"Varushkan Monster\">wolves</a> that inhabit certain isolated forests), these guardians prevent trespassers getting too close to whatever waits in the heart of the woodlands, allowing only certain powerful masters of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spring_magic\" title=\"Spring magic\">Spring magic</a> to enter and leave unmolested.</p><p>A little less than a year later, the forest around the Heart of the Tempest <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_flood_and_the_storm#Heart_of_the_Tempest\" title=\"The flood and the storm\">again started to expand</a> and there were rumours that the <i>dubik</i>-like creatures were pressing beyond its bounds. During the Solstice, however, the forest abruptly ceased expanding. Over the next several weeks, sightings of strange creatures tailed off and then ceased entirely. By the Spring Equinox, adventurous <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Warden\" title=\"Warden\">warden</a> fellowships venturing into the area reported that not only were the woodlands deserted but the structure at the heart of the forest had completely collapsed and lay in ruins entirely overgrown with vines and briars. If there was ever a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> here, they say, it has also disappeared.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Grimhold\">Grimhold</span></h3><p>In Spring 379YE, the Imperial Senate <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_Miekarova_II\" title=\"Fortify Miekarova II\">commissioned</a> the construction of a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miekarova#Perumaki\" title=\"Miekarova\">Perumaki</a>. Built in the Vale of Strascovia, home of the Vor'Azi people, it used the crumbling ruins of their ancestral castle as the foundation. The castle was completed in early 380YE and now broods over the surrounding forest. Following the Winter Solstice 382YE, the fortress was enshrouded in an eerie mist for the better part of a month. The mist disappeared as inexplicably as it appeared, and if the Vor'Azi know what it was about, they have not shared that knowledge with outsiders.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Embassy_to_Otkodov\">Embassy to Otkodov</span></h3><p>In <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miekarova#Mieriada\" title=\"Miekarova\">Mieriada</a>, just across the Coldmere from Wendell's Hope, stands the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambassador_to_Otkodov\" title=\"Ambassador to Otkodov\">Thule Embassy</a>, a cold and forbidding structure in the foothills of the northern mountains. Under snow for half the year, it is already seen as a poor posting by civil servants associated with the diplomatic corps. The Thule ambassador to the Empire, Rak Who-Speaks-For-The-Dragon's-Undivided, is likewise said to be a little regretful that he has had to leave the relative welcome of the <i>Red Lantern</i> inn in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#Void\" title=\"Volodmartz\">Void</a> for these comparatively less hospitable quarters. For their part, the Thule have repurposed a watchpost in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Otkodov#Skuld\" title=\"Otkodov\">K\u00f3gur</a> as their Imperial embassy. The drafty tower stands just on the other side of the border, overlooking one of the few passes through the northern mountains. Imperial civil servants posted to the Thule embassy to the Empire report that they are forbidden to venture into Skuld without an escort, and describe the embassy as cold, gloomy, and oppressive.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dupadealuri\">Dupadealuri</span></h3><p>The hills of Dupadealuri are scattered with vines that mine rich veins of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Tempest_Jade\" title=\"Materials\">Tempest Jade</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Weltsilver\" title=\"Materials\">weltsilver</a>.

As recently as 376YE a major offensive was launched through the northern mountains in an attempt to secure a beachhead near <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#Brez\">Void</a>; it is very unlikely to be the last.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodny\" title=\"Volodny\">Volodny</a> had their old centre of power in Volodmartz, and it was here that <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Alderei_the_Fair\" title=\"Alderei the Fair\">Alderei the tyrant-boyar</a> was defeated by the Imperial Army. The ruins of several strongholds still lie beneath the forest canopy. One of the most vicious battles took place in the foothills of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#Opascari\">Opascari</a> mountains at what is now a valuable <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#The_Hunt_of_Alderei_the_Fair\">weirwood forest</a>. This vital strategic asset, the largest source of weirwood in Varushka, was essential to the support of the tyrant-boyar's armies. The penultimate, savage battle of the Imperial campaign against Alderei took place here; after the forest was lost, his forces were forced to fall  back towards <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#Murupa\">Alderei's Run</a> in Murupa, where they finally met their end.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Following the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> invasion of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk\" title=\"Karsk\">Karsk</a> in 368YE, probing assaults were made against <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#Livardz\">Livardz</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#Suvretz\">Suvretz</a>.

Once a hotbed of support for Alderei the Fair on the edge of what was then Varushka, and the scene of savage fighting in the war against his forces. Empire armies laid siege to it, and burnt the original town to the ground. The tyrant-boyar sallied forth before the final assault, and gathered those still loyal from across Volodmartz and the wilds to his final battle to the north. Despite recent Imperial victories in Karsk, it is still considered to be a front-line settlement, doing all it can to support the campaign in Karsk. Home to many refugees, there is some pressure for these displaced Varushkans to return to their homes - homes that many rightly point out are still threatened by the remaining Thule armies.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sungold_Pass\">Sungold Pass</span></h3><p>High in the mountains of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#Opascari\">Opascari</a>, above the treeline on the easternmost peak known as the Traveller, lies <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sungold_Pass\" title=\"Sungold Pass\">Sungold Pass</a>.

The cabalists of the mountains of Brez tend to be somewhat isolationist; the best known settlement is the vale of <b>Void</b> in the western foothills, home to a number of allied cabals who study and perform those rituals best kept away from centres of population.

The vale did not survive their return. . Precisely what led to the doom of Ruin is unclear, but scattered rumours suggest that the miners came upon a trove of ancient pre-Imperial artefacts, and fell prey either to a maddening curse or possession by malign occult forces.

The scene of many vicious battles against the barbarians since before Varushka joined the Empire, it is scattered with fortresses, battlefields and ruins. It has an accursed reputation, and many stories refer to the \"<i>bloated crows of Karsk, grown fat from human flesh and suffering.</i>\" At one time this territory was home to numerous merchant boyars who became rich capturing and enslaving orcs to work in the mines of Volodmartz. When the Imperial orcs joined the Empire and it became illegal to keep orcish slaves, the senator for Karsk was brutally murdered during a meeting with a dozen now-ruined Karsk boyars including the last scion of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk_spoils_of_war#Zeleny_Zheleza\" title=\"Karsk spoils of war\">Zeleny</a> mining family.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>After a period of escalating raids, barbarian orcs invaded Karsk from the north in 368YE. In a series of surprise attacks they overwhelmed the border fortresses and pushed deep into the heart of the territory. The ferocity and sheer numbers involved in the assault took the Varushkans by surprise, and before the Empire could organize an effective counter-attack, Karsk had fallen. </p><p>The campaign against the orcs stretched on for several decades. A few vales held out against the barbarians, backed up by some Imperial forces, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_Magical_Traditions#Cabalists\" title=\"Varushka Magical Traditions\" class=\"mw-redirect\">cabal</a> or two and a few fellowships of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Warden\" title=\"Warden\">wardens</a>. Scattered reports revealed that the initial strong invasion quickly stalled. It soon became clear that the invading orcs were fighting among themselves, and with some of the few remaining indigenous orc bandits.</p><p>Following major offensives in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Moresvah\">Moresvah</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Nitrost\">Nitrost</a> a strike team assaulted the town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#The_Ruins_of_Isember\" title=\"Karsk\">Isember</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Lestasny\">Lestasny</a> during the Spring Equinox 378YE. A focal point for traitors aiding the Thule, victory resulted in the destruction of the town and drove Thule forces back into the eastern regions. Karsk was once again in Imperial hands - but the campaign was far from over. The Thule forces showed no sign of abandoning the territory. As the year lengthened, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/378YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#Amid_Ruined_hills\" title=\"378YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">the barbarians regrouped</a> and in Autumn <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/378YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#A_Tale_of_Fog_and_Ravens\" title=\"378YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">launched a counter-offensive</a>. During the Autumn Equinox, Nitrost was lost following a concerted Thule offensive, and with it Imperial control of the territory.</p><p>Within three months, however, the tide of war had turned back the other way. A major campaign by Varushkan, Navarr and Urizen forces aided by powerful ritual magic forced the Thule back out of Nitrost, returning the territory to Imperial hands. During the Winter Solstice 378YE, Karsk was once again made part of Varushka - but this time there was a good deal more discussion in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a>, and some talk of granting it to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs\" title=\"Imperial Orcs\">Imperial Orcs</a> as their first territory.</p><p>In Summer 379YE, the Empire <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Accept_Thule_peace_treaty\" title=\"Accept Thule peace treaty\">signed a peace treaty</a> with the Thule that ended hostilities along the northern borders.The Thule withdrew their forces from Karsk - apart from the region of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Krevsaty\">Krevsaty</a> which was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Powers_of_the_Imperial_Senate#Concedence\" title=\"Powers of the Imperial Senate\">conceded</a> to the orcs of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Otkodov\" title=\"Otkodov\">Otkodov</a> as part of the treaty.</p><p>Later that year, the Empire began work on <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#The_Crow_Roads\">roads</a> lining the vales of Karsk with each other and with the rest of Varushka. This large-scale construction project aided in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_army#Recruitment\" title=\"Imperial army\">recruitment</a> of a third <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_army\" title=\"Imperial army\">Imperial army</a>, and saw the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_military_concerns#The_Army_of_the_Iron_Helms\" title=\"Varushka military concerns\">Iron Helms</a>.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aleksandra.27s_Watch\">Aleksandra's Watch</span></h3><p><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_Lestasny_in_Karsk\" title=\"Fortify Lestasny in Karsk\">Commissioned</a> by the Senate in Spring 381YE, and designed by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Those_who_worship#Almodin_Okt.C3.ADstis.2C_Priest_of_the_Builder\" title=\"Those who worship\">Almodin Okt\u00edstis</a>, this <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> was completed with magical assistance shortly before the Winter Solstice 381YE. </p><p>The white granite used in the construction came exclusively from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Granites_of_Veltsgorsk\" title=\"Granites of Veltsgorsk\">Veltsgorsk</a>, and the walls bear distinctive bands of red, orange and pink quartz which have caused some travelers to give the fortification fanciful names such as \"<i>the Castle of Sunset</i>\". Where possible the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Asavean_Archipelago\" title=\"Asavean Archipelago\">Asavean</a> architect has arranged the bands in swirling arabesques which, while attractive, are somewhat at odds with the dark hills of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Lestasny\">Lestasny</a>. Indeed, the entire fortification is subtly \"off\" to Varushkan eyes. While the architect has followed the traditional lines of a Varushkan fortress - a solid gatehouse, keep, and wall surmounted by circular towers with high sloped roofs - the structure is informed by Asavean sensibilities. There are few straight lines in the place; walls and passages tend to curve and bend; rooms are usually circular or oval. The layout is much more open and relaxed than is traditional in Varushka, and more than one visitor has remarked that at times it is a little like being inside a giant seashell. </p><p>When the fortification was completed, it is also significantly more decorated than is usual for Varushka. They incorporated numerous mosaics and statues of bull-headed figures with a distinctly irreligious aspect. Shortly after the castle was complete, the Senate <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rebuild_Aleksandra%27s_Watch\" title=\"Rebuild Aleksandra's Watch\">voted</a> to redesign the castle, removing the statues and the mosaics. By order of the boyar of Ivarsgard, the idolatrous statues were used to gravel the courtyard, so that every Imperial boot that entered the fortification would be treading the Asavean gods underfoot.</p><p>Built above the vale of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Ivarsgard\">Ivarsgard</a>, the castle is named for the late Aleksandra Irinova Prochnost, a revered wise one. Her preserved remains are interred in the highest tower of the keep, overlooking the vale; there is a saying among the people of Ivarsgard, \"<i>Remember, Grandmother is always watching you</i>\". In catacombs beneath the keep lies the vale's ossuary filled with the bones of those who fell during the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> invasion. Here the influence of the Asavean architect is still somewhat noticeable - while the mosaics of leaping dolphins have been removed, the ossuary passages still form a series of interlocking spirals.<span id=\"The_Roads_of_Karsk\"></span></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Crow_Roads\">The Crow Roads</span></h3><p>In Autumn 379YE, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rebuild_the_roads_of_Karsk\" title=\"Rebuild the roads of Karsk\">major public work's project</a> was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Commission\" title=\"Commission\">commissioned</a> to restore the devastated <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushkan_Road\" title=\"Varushkan Road\">roads</a> of Karsk. As a consequence, the roads are in excellent repair and almost every major settlement in Karsk is now connected to them, and through them to the rest of the Empire. A great deal of white granite was invested in the project, and every seventh stone was carefully prepared to reinforce the warding <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_hearth_magic\" title=\"Varushka hearth magic\">hearth magic</a>. This <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_work\" title=\"Great work\">great work</a> not only increases the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prosperity\" title=\"Prosperity\">prosperity</a> of every <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mine</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forest</a> in Karsk, but also speeded the recovery of the war-torn land. As a consequence, the Varushkan nation was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Crow_on_the_cradle#Supply\" title=\"Crow on the cradle\">able</a> to begin <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Raise_Varushkan_army\" title=\"Raise Varushkan army\">restoring</a> the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Crow_on_the_cradle#Armies\" title=\"Crow on the cradle\">Iron Helms</a> army - and to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_army#Maximum_numbers_of_Imperial_Forces\" title=\"Imperial army\">support</a> a third army, much earlier than might otherwise have been possible. Since their completion, more local Varushkans have been referring to the roads as the \"<i>Crow Roads</i>\" - perhaps a reference to their connection to the Iron Helms.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ivarsgard\">Ivarsgard</span></h3><p>Once a prosperous settlement on the shores of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Semmerlak\" title=\"The Semmerlak\">the Semmerlak</a>, in the centuries before the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Orc_Rebellion\" title=\"The Orc Rebellion\">orc revolt</a> the vale grew rich from the profits of its slave labour-fueled mines and forests. After the rebellion, the vale closed its <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forests</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Business\" title=\"Business\">timber yards</a> and developed a new economy based on foreign trade with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fleet\" title=\"Fleet\">ships</a> constructed with the last output of its slave-based industry. </p><p>When the Thule barbarians invaded, Ivarsgard fell before their armies. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_leadership\" title=\"Varushka leadership\">boyar</a> and his <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_military_concerns\" title=\"Varushka military concerns\">schlacta</a> stayed behind allowing a small group of survivors to escape across the Semmerlak. The lucky ones who managed to flee founded a new home, near <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karov#Malimorza\" title=\"Karov\">Karotny</a>, establishing the outpost of Ugleyzastava on the eastern shores of the lake. Those less fortunate were taken by the Thule and, in a cruel twist of irony, forced into the re-opened mines and lumber yards by their new orc overlords. While the slaves were freed when Lestazny was liberated, the ruins of Ivarsgard remained uninhabited save by squatters and borderland bandits for some time. One of the first to return was the late Aleksandra Irinova Prochnost. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mark_the_Flesh_Incorruptible\" title=\"Mark the Flesh Incorruptible\">preserved remains</a> of the revered wise one have been placed with great reverence in a simple bier in what will one day be the central square of the settlement.</p><p>Shortly after the Spring Equinox 380YE, Senator Maarit <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Commission\" title=\"Commission\">commissioned</a> a project to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Construct_vale_in_Karsk\" title=\"Construct vale in Karsk\">rebuild the vale of Ivarsgard</a>. White granite and weirwood were provided, as well as money to cover labour costs, but the materials and funds were supplemented by volunteer labour. A number of displaced citizens of Karsk had taken refuge in the forests here and, following discussions with the exiled Boyar of Ivarsgard, agreed to help rebuild the vale in return for a place within its walls. A call has gone out for survivors of the fall of Ivarsgard to return and lend their strength to restoring the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prosperity\" title=\"Prosperity\">prosperity</a> of the reborn vale. </p><p>It is not just former citizens that have come to Ivarsgard; merchants from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarcophan_Delves\" title=\"Sarcophan Delves\">Sarcophan Delves</a> negotiated a special mooring at the docks here which was  <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Create_title_Custodian_of_Ivarsgard_Docks\" title=\"Create title Custodian of Ivarsgard Docks\">approved by the Senate</a> in Summer 382YE.

A basic quay has been laid in, as well as a number of buildings - including an armoury. While many of the structures inside the walls are currently tents, they are supplemented by more permanent structures as the prosperity of the area continues to grow.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Veresk\">Veresk</span></h3><p>Before the Thule invasion, the vale of Veresk was known for its musicians and entertainers. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk_spoils_of_war#Vereski_Stzena\" title=\"Karsk spoils of war\">Vereski Stzena</a> were based here, operating a well-respected school that was one of the few structures to emerge mostly unscathed after multiple attempts by the orcs of Otkoov to conquer the town. Veresk never fell, and was a focus of Imperial scouting activity for much of the war. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Warden\" title=\"Warden\">Wardens</a> watching the area were among the first to report incidents of orcs fighting orcs within the barbarian encampments there. Later investigations suggested that these were conflicts with \"local\" orcs under the guidance of the Charnel Lord of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Broken_Barrow\">Broken Barrow</a>, many of whom still live in the vicinity of the haunted hill.</p><p>Veresk was severely damaged during the invasion, but in the years since it has been largely rebuilt by the stubborn survivors who refused to leave their homes. One of the most recent additions to Veresk is the famous <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Series_of_dreams#The_Empress_of_all_Goats_Theatre\" title=\"Series of dreams\">Empress of all Goats Theatre</a>, built by the Eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Barien\" title=\"Barien\">Barien</a> for Hubert Annanovich Gremani as a reward for completing a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Challenge_the_Iron_Duke\" title=\"Challenge the Iron Duke\">Challenge</a> from the Iron Duke. The theatre has since been expanded, and is now widely respected as a major cultural site by many Varushkans. Most of the plays, even the most comedic, contain valuable lessons for their audiences and have proved popular outisde the borders of Karsk - indeed some have been adapted for the stage in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Temeschwar\" title=\"Temeschwar\">Temeschwar</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg\" title=\"Holberg\">Holberg</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Broken_Barrow\">Broken Barrow</span></h3><p>A scattered set of stone structures atop a mound, the Broken Barrow is one of the oldest and best known abodes of a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushkan_Monster#Sovereigns\" title=\"Varushkan Monster\">sovereign</a> in Varushka. A great stone slab lies in two pieces on top of the central structures. Legend says that its a barrow, and it is the lair of the <b>Charnel Lord</b> - by its own accounts an aged and terrible creature that predates the earliest settlers in the area. While the barrow is empty, the hill is apparently riddled with passages and galleries and it is here that the Charnel Lord sleeps. The people of the nearby area, especially the inhabitants of the vales of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Branoc\">Branoc</a> look to the Charnel Lord as a protector. During the Thule invasion, the Charnel Lord allied first with one side and then the other, finally throwing its support behind the Empire. According to stories, it extracted a promise from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_look_and_feel#Wise_Ones\" title=\"Varushka look and feel\">wise ones</a> of Varushka to look after its people, and then slipped back into a deep slumber somewhere beneath the hill.</p><p>Varushkans do not linger here after dark, but there is a small settlement of independent orcs here that apparently enjoy the protection of the Charnel Lord. While they have never been formally recognised by the Imperial Senate, they trade quietly with their neighbours and keep themselves to themselves. Some stories claim they are the descendants of Thule raiders, or of the orcs who once lived in the hills and forests here before the coming of humans. Regardless, they have little love for the orcs of Otkododv and seem to have little interest in the wider politics of the Empire..</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Ruins_of_Isember\">The Ruins of Isember</span></h3><p>Grew rich off the back of orc slaves, hacking prime timber out of the rich forests overseen by hard-eyed schlacta. When the slaves were freed, and the mercenaries left, the wolves in the forest grew bolder. Isember was in decline long before the orcs came, known as a violent place where anyone could carve out a new living for themselves, with no questions asked as to their background. Evidence came to light that many of the town\u2019s inhabitants may have made bargains with the invaders, and that exiles and outlaws from across the Empire were coming here to fight under the Thule banners. In Spring 378YE a decisive battle was fought here, and the town of Isember largely ruined in what was a turning point in the war with the Thule. The people of Karsk show little interest in rebuilding it.</p><p>One of the few structures still standing is the poorly-named <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk_spoils_of_war#The_Sovereigns_Heart\" title=\"Karsk spoils of war\">Sovereigns Heart</a>, a hostelry that saw excellent <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Business\" title=\"Business\">business</a> during the liberation of Karsk, primarily serving Imperial troops raiding the Thule. It proved especially popular with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs\" title=\"Imperial Orcs\">Imperial Orcs</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a> raiders alike. The precarious nature of the inn - right on the edge of Thule-claimed territory - added a certain dark desperation to the drinking and fighting that were a regular feature of a night spent here. It remains to be seen what effect a lasting <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Accept_Thule_peace_treaty\" title=\"Accept Thule peace treaty\">peace with the Thule</a> will have on business here.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Branoc\">Branoc</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The raven-haunted hills of Branoc are the site of the sinister <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#broken_barrow\">broken barrow</a>. The entire region has a poor reputation, as do several of the vales established here. During the war to liberate Karsk from the Thule, the introverted Varushkan folk of these vales fought under a single banner - and not always on the side of the Empire. Today they have largely reintegrated with the rest of Varushka - a number of them helped to form the core of the Iron Helms - but they are still said to have odd customs related to the Charnel Lord of the Broken Barrow. There are said to be one or two vales high in the hills that have little time for Imperial visitors, and cling to pre-Imperial attitudes. Branoc is also the site of a small settlement of independant orcs who engage in low-key trade with their human neighbors, despite having a nebulously defined legal status.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crowslook\">Crowslook</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />A desolate hilly region, the site of many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a>, and also the site of vicious fighting with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_orcs\" title=\"Imperial orcs\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Imperial orcs</a> during <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Orc_Rebellion\" title=\"The Orc Rebellion\">the Orc Rebellion</a>.

These creatures are said to be the remnants of orcs who died of starvation during the cold Winters - not only during the Rebellion but in the centuries of slavery that preceded it.</p><p>When Karsk was conquered during the reign of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Richilde\" title=\"Empress Richilde\">Empress Richilde</a>, a hidden temple dedicated to the eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Agramant\" title=\"Agramant\">Agramant</a> was discovered high in the hills of Crowslook The temple was destroyed and the worshippers scattered. During the reign of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Varkula\" title=\"Empress Varkula\">Empress Varkula</a> the region was again revealed to be the heart of a conspiracy dedicated to the <i>Hunter in the Wastes</i>, a subtle \"cult\" that sought to place its members in positions of authority in the Empire but was exposed when they made an ill-considered overture to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Cardinal\" title=\"Cardinal\">Cardinal</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">Vigilance</a>. A third such cult came to light shortly before <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Deanne\" title=\"Empress Deanne\">Empress Deanne</a> took the throne, seeking to take advantage of the Imperial focus on the southern coast to unleash a horde of hungry dead to ravage Karsk. The cult was exposed and ultimately defeated by Varushkan wardens, although stories suggest they had the aid of dark spirits of their own. Whenever there is trouble with Agramant in Varushka, it seems to invariably be traced back to the hills of Crowslook.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kopevnost\">Kopevnost</span></h3><p>Kopvenost is (for Varushka) a gentle region of low hills and scattered woodlands.

The region itself never fell to the northern <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a>; the Empire mounted a spirited defence from the high-walled town of <b>Kosti</b> each time the Thule tried to push west.

The vale was once a great centre for the making of defensive talismans. Wise Volhov, natural amber, and the silence of isolation combined to make great magics. Oloy fell quickly to the Thule; few of the Varushkans who lived here escaped and those few who did told of magical treasures hurriedly hidden from the invaders. Perhaps some of those troves still elude the eyes of the regions new masters.</p><p>The peace with the Empire is a little uneasy on occasion but has held comparatively well.

It causes nightmares and impedes efforts to settle the territory. At one time there were <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj_miasma#Miasma_Pillars\" title=\"Druj miasma\">miasma pillars</a> in each of the seven regions. Efforts by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Cardinal\" title=\"Cardinal\">Cardinal</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">Vigilance</a> identified the locations of some of the stones that anchor the miasma in place, and the scouts pouring into the territory this season have located the rest. As of the end of the Autumn Equinox, it is believed that there are only two miasma pillars still standing in Ossium - one at the Fang Tree, in the Webwood, and the other somewhere in the depths of Thule-controlled Bonewood. It is not clear whether the latter pillar is active or if the warlocks of Otkodov have already removed it. </p><p>With most of the pillars supporting it destroyed by Imperial heroes, the miasma is unravelling, but it still lies thick and oppressive over the Webwood.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lomaa\">Lomaa</span></h3><p>A shambolic town on the Galath Fields, built over the Crawling Depths. The civil service has established an office here to help oversee the development of the territory. Many Varushkan settlers come here first, before dispersing across the territory, giving it a frontier feel. A number of merchants from further east are drawn here, making a quick profit selling vital supplies to the Varushkan, and it is also the site of a thriving market where representatives of the newly established vales come to sell their wares to traders intending to return east.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ketsov\">Ketsov</span></h3><p>Ketsov is home to the human clan of the same name, an ambitious family who actually prospered under the Druj to an extent. They are the most eager of the Ossium natives to embrace the Varushkan egregore, being descended from settlers who crossed the border from Karsk many years ago. The inhabitants of the town and the surrounding settlements clearly have Varushkan heritage and many seem eager to adopt Varushkan ways. Symbols of the Bone Scorpion, that once adorned the town have been carefully and meticulously erased. In their place people are now putting new banners and paintings: most are variants of the stylised double-headed eagle clutching axes that is a traditional symbol of Varushka.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Burgher_of_Ketsov\" title=\"Burgher of Ketsov\">Ketsov Trade Exchange</a> was established here shortly before the Summer Solstice 383YE, allowing the Ketsov to trade that same expertise in crafting magic items that made them useful to the Druj to their new Imperial neighbours. A significant portion of the Ketsov are now reported to have been bonded to the Varushkan <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Egregores\" title=\"Egregores\">egregore</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Field_of_Glory\">The Field of Glory</span></h3><p>This ironic name is given to the site of one of the first significant engagements between the Imperial forces and the Druj. Some twenty thousand human and orc farmers and fishers who had fled the invading force were corralled by the Druj, given makeshift weapons and driven to engage Imperial forces. The result was a bloodbath, with barely a handful of Imperials injured or slain and thousands of farmers or fisherfolk wounded and killed. The battlefield has since been discovered to be rich in marrowort, although some reports suggest the area is now haunted by the ghosts of terrified and angry orcs and humans caught between the malice of the Druj and the zeal of the Imperial armies.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Palace_of_Orieb\">The Palace of Orieb</span></h3><p>The sprawling, partially flooded palace of Orieb is believed to have been home to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj_lore#Buruk_Tepel\" title=\"Druj lore\">Buruk Tepel</a> of the Bone Serpent clan. It has been abandoned, but the maze-like structure has still only been partially mapped. It is a peculiar and somewhat unsettling combination of living area, apothecary workshop, palace, political hub, and herb garden with plants growing inside the structure in internal gardens - some open to the elements and others roofed with glass or cunning wooden shutters that can be adjusted to control the amount of rain and sun that reaches them.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Marshstand_Skerry\">Marshstand Skerry</span></h3><p>Standing in the Drownbark Forest, the Marshstand Skerry is a low rock that allegedly used to be tended by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj_lore#Ghulai\" title=\"Druj lore\">ghulai</a> of the Bone Serpent. It has apparently been abandoned since the territory was first invaded - allegedly since before the Webwood fell. The rock is surrounded by decades or perhaps even centuries worth of bones from creatures - some of them clearly humans or orcs - drowned or interred in the marshy waters to rot. The place has a poor reputation - it is both considered to be haunted and also known to be home to especially large, viciously bloodthirsty insects similar to mosquitos.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tower_of_the_Scorpion\">Tower of the Scorpion</span></h3><p>A grand tower of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/White_granite\" title=\"White granite\">white granite</a>, surrounded by a wall topped with twisted metal razors, and standing in a large, open killing field. A network of rope bridges extends from wood towers that squat under the shadow of the walls. In the season following the Autumn Equinox 382YE, Imperial armies captured the Tower of the Scorpion from the Amber Scorpion clan, significantly damaging, but still claiming it.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crawling_Depths\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Crawling_Depths\" title=\"Crawling Depths\">Crawling Depths</a></span></h3><p>The Depths are a mithril mine under the settlement of Lomaa. Custodianship of the Depths is an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Title\" title=\"Imperial Title\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Imperial Title</a> that brings with it a Seat on the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Bourse\" title=\"Imperial Bourse\">Imperial Bourse</a>. It produces 14 Imperial wains of mithril every season. Control is allocated to any Imperial citizen by open auction during the Autumn Equinox.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Silent_Pines\">The Silent Pines</span></h3><p>The Silent Pines is a large weirwood grove in the central Bonewood. It is controlled by the Thule. The human slaves who were part of the labour force used to maintain and farm the woodlands here were delivered to Kark shortly after the orcs of Otkodov cemented their hold here. Many of the inhabitants of the Galath Fields and Bittershore claim the Silent Pines are \"cursed\" in some fashion. Despite this, many structures across Ossium were clearly crafted from weirwood taken from the groves - the timber is very dark and the Druj often polished and varnished it in such a way to call out the patterns hidden in the wood in a way that is both attractive and somewhat unsettling.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trods\">Trods</span></h3><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trods\" title=\"Trods\" class=\"mw-redirect\">trods</a> of Ossium, established by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> during a brutal battle that took place in the territory during the Autumn Equinox 382YE, are only partially explored.

It lies along the eastern banks of the Semmerlak, and one end of the Golden Causeway is anchored here. The Causeway is quiescent at the moment, but all it would take is a Dawnish witch to open it and the shimmering bridge would stretch back across the lake to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Semmerholm#Laroc\" title=\"Semmerholm\">Laroc</a> in Semmerholm. Prior to the Imperial invasion, Bittershore was home to the Sand Fisher clan of orcs. The Imperial Senate <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Powers_of_the_Imperial_Senate#Concedence\" title=\"Powers of the Imperial Senate\">ceded</a> the region of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg#Misericorde\" title=\"Holberg\">Misericorde</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg\" title=\"Holberg\">Holberg</a> to the Sand Fishers and the entire nation moved south across the Semmerlak to Holberg. </p><p>Varushkan settlers have already begun to establish vales on the shores of the lake, taking advantage of the rich fishing opportunities and fertile farmland. As the prosperity of the region increases, the likelihood that Varushka will be able to support another <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_army\" title=\"Imperial army\">Imperial army</a> increases.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bonewood\">Bonewood</span></h3><ul><li> <b>Quality:</b>\u00a0Forest, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Otkodov\" title=\"Otkodov\">Otkodov</a><br /></li></ul><p>The northernmost region of Ossium is the Bonewood, which allegedly takes its name either from the rich profusion of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Beggar.27s_Lye\" title=\"Materials\">beggarwood trees</a> or from the number of bleached bones that litter the forest, remnants of many historical battles between the Druj and either the Thule or the Varushkans. Even before it was conquered by the Thule, the forest had a dire reputation for being \"haunted\". The local orcs tell grim tales of shadowy figures that prey on travellers among the ancient pines, leaving blood-drained corpses in their wake. The Thule have not welcomed Imperial scouts into this area. They have been polite but firm, and made it clear that they are not welcome. The pine forests have been lightly mapped; they extend north to the borders of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Otkodov#Sk.C3.BCld\" title=\"Otkodov\">Sk\u00fcld</a>, and west to the borders of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karsk#Krevsaty\" title=\"Karsk\">Krevsaty</a>. There is known to be a large weirwood forest here - the <b>Silent Pines</b> - which is now controlled by the Thule.</p><p>There is also a castle here -\u00a0<b>Fljajokep</b>\u00a0- controlled by the Thule. It overlooks the Silent Pines and was finished in a mere six months, the construction supplemented by powerful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Autumn_magic\" title=\"Autumn magic\">Autumn magic</a>. It stands at one end of a narrow but well-travelled pathway that extends from the Silent Pines south toward Ketsov, and was used by the Druj to transport shipments of weirwood south into more open ground.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drownbark_Forest\">Drownbark Forest</span></h3><ul><li> <b>Qualities:</b> Forest, Marsh<br /></li></ul><p>The last region of Ossium conquered by the Empire, the Drownbark Forest is a stinking marsh covered with moss-shrouded, dripping forest. Varushkan settlers have comparatively little experience dealing with the marshy terrain of the Drownbark Forest, and there are no vales established here.</p><p>In the depths of Drownbark Forest is the Druj town of\u00a0<b>Orieb</b>, a settlement surrounding a sprawling and labyrinthine Druj palace. From discussions with the local populace, it appears that Orieb was the seat of one of the Druj clans that dominated Ossium - the Bone Serpent clan - ruled with an iron fist by an ancient <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj_lore#Buruk_Tepel\" title=\"Druj lore\">Buruk Tepel</a> named\u00a0<i>Bleakbane</i>. The Buruk Tepel herself, and her apprentices, have not been accounted for. The town is composed of stinking hovels, populated by a number of freed orc and human slaves, who have thus far cooperated fully with the liberating forces. There only real concentration of Varushkans in the region is centred here - three bands of wagon raiders from Karsk and southern Volodmartz have congregated, creating a small enclave surrounding the Stinking Market where they sell valuables wrenched not only from the depths of the Drownbark Forest but also from daring raids across the border into Farweald and the Forest of Ulnak.</p><p>In Autumn 383YE, scouts reported the presence of something significantly more dangerous than even Druj bandits in the Drownbark Forest. There is at least one group of horrible unliving servants - tormented souls bound into the tormented corpses of Dawnish knights - in the Drownbark Forest. It's not clear if they are part of a larger force, or whether like the tormented souls of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a> they have broken free of the control of their Druj masters. Regardless, the scouts deliver warnings to settlers in the area to give them a wide berth.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Echofell\">Echofell</span></h3><ul><li> <b>Quality:</b>\u00a0Forest<br /></li></ul><p>The Echofell was the home of the Amber Scorpion clan of the Druj, and the site of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ossium#Tower_of_the_Scorpion\">Tower of the Scorpion</a>. The first real engagement of the invasion took place here when Imperial forces besieged the tower during torrential rain. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> was ultimately overrun and captured by the Empire - it is now garrisoned by a small force of Varushkans. A posting to the Tower of the Scorpion is seen as a particularly unpalatable tour of service by most Varushkan soldiers. While most of the Druj have been driven from the area eastward in to the the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Mallum#The_Forest_of_Ulnak\" title=\"The Mallum\">Forest of Ulnak</a>, the woods are home to a disturbing number of unpleasant insects and poisonous creatures that seem to enjoy feasting on human blood.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Galath_Fields\">Galath Fields</span></h3><p>Along with Bittershore, the Galath Fields represent the only real open ground in Ossium. The soil here is rich, and the damp grasslands are scattered with smaller settlements belonging to native orcs, most of whom are cautiously welcoming of the Imperial presence. There are two larger settlements - the town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ossium#Lomaa\">Lomaa</a> which sits above the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Crawling_Depths\" title=\"Crawling Depths\">Crawling Depths</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ossium#Ketsov\">Ketsov</a>, home to the human clan of the same name. As with Bittershore, the Galath Fields have proved popular with Varushkan settlers, especially those from wealthy <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karov\" title=\"Karov\">Karov</a> looking to start new vales in the comparative safety of the new territory.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nearweald\">Nearweald</span></h3><ul><li> <b>Quality:</b>\u00a0Forest<br /></li></ul><p>One of the last regions of Ossium conquered, Nearweald borders onto <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Barrens#Farweald\" title=\"The Barrens\">Farweald</a> - the northernmost part of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Barrens\" title=\"The Barrens\">the Barrens</a>. The woodlands here are dense, and broken up by maze-like game trails, and overgrown pathways. Most of the Druj who inhabited this area retreated into the Barrens once it was clear Ossium was lost, but as with the Webwood there are still a few small bands living in the depths of the woods who emerge sporadically to raid Varushkan settlements.</p><p>A particularly bloody-minded band of settlers from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz#Livardz\" title=\"Volodmartz\">Livardz</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Volodmartz\" title=\"Volodmartz\">Volodmartz</a> have claimed an extensive section of the forest and despite some opposition from the bandits have established a relatively secure vale here named <b>Karantzy</b> from which they are engaging in extensive logging. The timber from the Nearwald is being sold to other settlers, and has proved extremely popular for helping new settlers establish vales across Bittershore and Galath Fields. Boyar <i>Irina Karantzy</i> and her allies are making money hand over fist. Not only from the trees themselves - Nearweald is particularly rich in precious <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Ambergelt\" title=\"Materials\">ambergelt</a> that has a particularly vibrant crimson colouration that is already being touted as \"blood amber\".</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Webwood\">Webwood</span></h3><ul><li> <b>Quality:</b>\u00a0Forest<br /></li></ul><p>The Webwood is a dank, almost impenetrable forest with few trails. As its name implies it is home to large numbers of spiders - many of them either very large or very venomous. There is a well-hidden structure in its depths which apparently serves as a temple or lair for orcs dedicated to the service of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eternal\" title=\"Eternal\">eternal</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Arhallogen\" title=\"Arhallogen\">Arhallogen</a> dubbed the <b>Temple of Arhallogen</b>. It is not entirely clear if the orcs are really Druj or not, or whether they are an example of a nation that managed to maintain some level of independence despite living in a land oppressed by the Druj. The orcs have kept very much to themselves, but there have nonetheless been disappearances reported in the area which is littered with traps and deadfalls that pose a constant threat to travelers and settlers.</p><p>The \"temple\" has been recognised by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Conclave\" title=\"Imperial Conclave\">Imperial Conclave</a> as being the property of Arhallogen, and Varushkan settlers are discouraged from attempting to establish vales here. This has not stopped the most ambitious or bloody minded from starting to build along the southern and western margins.</p><p>Webwood is perhaps the most dangerous and least explored region of Ossium, and there are known to be at least two bands of Druj bandits in the depths who periodically emerge to raid Varushkan settlements, reaching as far afield as the north-western Galath Fields and the northern Echofell.</p><p><span id=\"Ossium_characters\"></span></p><div class=\"box\"><div class=\"box-inner\"><b>Ossium Characters</b><p>Ossium is on the list of territories new Varushkan characters can come from.

The beautiful rolling plains are dotted with woodlands and carefully maintained parks, and with great stone chapterhouses that date back to the first years of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_History\" title=\"Highguard History\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Revelation</a>. Since the end of the Highborn civil war, Bastion has presented the calm, serene visage of the Highborn to the world. During the founding of the Empire, Bastion very nearly became the \"official\" capital of the Empire in 3YE; at the last minute the Senate decided to hold their quarterly gatherings in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Anvil\" title=\"Casinea\">Anvil</a> instead.</p><p>It was settled in the first years after <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_history#The_founding\" title=\"Highguard history\">the founding</a>; but the focus of the early years remained on the southern territory of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Pharos\" title=\"Necropolis\">Pharos</a>. Considered a hinterland where a military presence was necessary rather than a place to settle, Bastion remained sparsely populated for decades; most settlements were little more than small fortifications along the northern and eastern borders. Things began to change as the first ripples of the Revelation began to shake Highborn society. As the patricians became more and more embroiled in their personal feuds and agendas, the Highborn who would become the founders of the Revelation sought fresh opportunities in Bastion.</p><p>The civil war swept across Bastion as well as Pharos, and several chapters were destroyed in the fighting. Several have never been restored, left as reminders of the follies of the past and a warning to the future. Once the war was over, however, the new Assembly of the Virtuous constructed a new city along the banks of the Couros, seeking a new start for their people and their nation.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>When the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> initially conquered <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a>, they launched several strikes across the river into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion#Sybela_Cross\">Sybela Cross</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion#The_Elms\">the Elms</a>. These were repulsed, but not before bringing down the fortification of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion#Sybella_Cross\">the White Tower</a>. Many refugees from the lost territory made new homes in Bastion. Over time, some abandoned any intention to returning to Reikos, and there was some friction between established Bastion chapters, and those refugees who now consider themselves citizens of Bastion. Now that Reikos has been liberated, the tension has lessened significantly - most of those forced to seek sanctuary here have returned to rebuild and those who remain are rapidly assimilating .</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bastion.2C_the_White_City\">Bastion, the White City</span></h3><p>The sacred city of Bastion, the White City, is a marvel of marble and mosaic. Even her enemies cannot deny her magnificence \u2013 the white marble domes and towers raised up to the demonstrate the glory of a virtuous life, the roads trodden smooth by the footsteps of countless philosophers, warriors and pilgrims. More garden than city, the skyline is dominated by the tall spires and elegant architecture of the huge chapterhouses. The entire city has been expressly designed as a monument to the devotion of the Highborn. When the Imperial Synod recognizes a paragon or exemplar, then a new basilica is constructed here to celebrate their life and deeds.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-left\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:ShatteredGuardians.png\" class=\"image\" title=\"Refugees from Reikos have established new homes in Bastion - some more permanent than others.\"><img alt=\"Refugees from Reikos have established new homes in Bastion - some more permanent than others.\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/dd/ShatteredGuardians.png/350px-ShatteredGuardians.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/d/dd/ShatteredGuardians.png 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/d/dd/ShatteredGuardians.png 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">Guardians of the Shattered Tower keep a watch on the borders of Highguard.</div></div><p>Few Highborn dwell here permanently but most important folk make a pilgrimage once every year. Every chapter maintains a hostel in the great city, to serve as a dwelling for members who visit. The wealthiest and most powerful Highborn often possess their own residence here, but the city is much more a symbol than it is an active urban centre. During the formation of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a>, the citizens of the White City were approached about joining and politely rebuffed. Historians suggest the other cities of the modern League were actually quite relieved - Bastion is a city in name only, and neither its wealth nor its population approach that of a major urban centre like <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Temeschwar\" title=\"Temeschwar\">Temeschwar</a> or <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato\" title=\"Tassato\">Tassato</a>.</p><p>One of the oldest structures in Bastion is the <b>Spire of the Open Hand</b>; in pre-Imperial days, it served as an embassy from the people of Urizen to the people of Highguard. Even after the foundation of the Empire, the spire continued to serve as an embassy until Urizen officially became the ninth nation during the reign of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Giovanni\" title=\"Emperor Giovanni\">Emperor Giovanni</a>. Today, the three pale towers that made up the spire serve as a combination of school and museum.</p><p>Bastion is a site of pilgrimage for followers of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way\" title=\"The Way\">the Way</a> but within the city itself are several specific places of note. The ruins of the <b>Lepidean Library</b>, for example, are a valuable lesson of the importance of maintaining <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">Vigilance</a>.

Seven chapels, one dedicated to each of the virtues, form an outer ring around a single great hall beneath a white marble dome. The great cathedral stands at the heart of a public park through which seven wide avenues extend, serving as the \"spokes\" around which the rest of the city was originally arranged. The Highborn still use the Basilica of Seven Doors for important festivities; for many years the duty of overseeing the citadel and its grounds fell to the <i>Custodes Clavium</i> - a Highborn chapter named for the ring of keys they notionally hold, each one used to secure one of the gates to the citadel. In the Summer 383YE, following the completion of extensive refurbishments, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Speaker_of_the_Highborn_Assembly\" title=\"Speaker of the Highborn Assembly\">Speaker of the Highborn Assembly</a> took over custodianship of the Basilica.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sybela\">Sybela</span></h3><p>A small trading town where goods from local farms are sold, Sybela boasts an unusually large number of inns, since it acts as a crossroads for travel between Highguard, the League, Urizen and Dawn. It is a key stopping point on the pilgrim routes to Highguard. For some, the journey is an important as the destination and Sybela is one place where pilgrims meet, and join together to travel through the still-dangerous lands between the civilised places of the world.</p><p>By <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Town_defences\" title=\"Town defences\" class=\"mw-redirect\">order</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a>, in early 377YE a series of watchtowers and fortified inns were constructed around Sybela following an increase in banditry.

There are few actual chapterhouses here - while most Highborn Chapters maintain a small residence in the city itself, few are actually based here. Those that are are usually concerned with the maintenance and support of the city proper.</p><p>One of the best known of these local chapters is <b>Ravensfell</b>. Directly north of Bastion city on top of a rocky outcrop over the valley that carries the river Couros, in more peaceful times the chapterhouse was a staging post for traders and travellers on pilgrimage to Bastion city from Reikos and Urizen. Recently, the chapter has been defending the crossing of the river Couros from Druj incursion, and offering shelter to refugees from Reikos.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Elms\">The Elms</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The Elmwood Forest is the wildest part of Bastion. The chapters established here tend to be a little more introspective than those in the rest of Bastion; several maintain <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forest</a> preserves while others take advantage of the wild woods to hone their combat and survival skills. Several of these more martial chapters are especially active in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_military_concerns\" title=\"Highguard military concerns\">armies of Highguard</a>; the region is known for the strength, fortitude, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Courage\" title=\"Courage\">Courage</a> of its guardians. Their martial might was tested several times during the Druj occupation of Reikos. The orcs raided regularly across the river and on one occasion in 372YE attempted to establish a beachhead here; they were repulsed by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_military_concerns#The_Seventh_Wave\" title=\"Highguard military concerns\">Seventh Wave</a> after a months-long campaign through the woodlands during which the expertise of the chapters here proved a key advantage in driving the Druj back across the Haros.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stoneside\">Stoneside</span></h3><p>The woodlands of Stoneside cannot really be described as a \"forest\". Broad avenues are maintained between the trees, and much of the region has the feel of a great park or even orchard, rather than a wild wood. Stoneside is hope to several large and prosperous chapterhouses, and also to a special site of pilgrimage. In central Stoneside there is a great rock carved with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Runes\" title=\"Runes\">runes</a>, allegedly carried here from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark\" title=\"Hahnmark\">Hahnmark</a> by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Paragons_and_Exemplars\" title=\"Paragons and Exemplars\" class=\"mw-redirect\">exemplar</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Inga_Tarn\" title=\"Inga Tarn\">Inga Tarn</a> as part of a pilgrimage of her own.

Prior to her arrival the region was called <i>East Woods</i>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sybella_Cross\">Sybella Cross</span></h3><p>Sybella Cross is rich farmland scattered with fortified chapters; some of the oldest in the Empire were founded here in the first diaspora from Pharos. The rich town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion#Sybela\">Sybela</a> is stands in the south, while in the north the ruins of the fortification known as the <b>White Tower</b> (brought down in 369YE by the Druj) still keep an uneasy vigil over the trods that lead north into Reikos. The ruins have been somewhat restored as part of the ongoing fortification, but the watchtower and palisade are a poor shadow of the great white granite walls that stood here until the orcs of the Stone Toad clan took them down. It is also the site of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/High_Herbalist_of_Sybella\" title=\"High Herbalist of Sybella\">Sybella Cross Physician's Hall</a>, an establishment that purchases <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Herb\" title=\"Herb\">herbs</a> from the citizens of Bastion, and serves as a medical academy focusing on the use of herbs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Woodbury\">Woodbury</span></h3><p>The scattered woodlands here are well maintained, and provide building materials for construction work all over Highguard and beyond. In the early years of the Empire, Woodbury was extensively forested; three centuries of major construction work have seen most of the old forest disappear leaving a number of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Business\" title=\"Business\">carefully cultivated woodlands</a> and a lot of open grassland largely used as pasture. Unlike the chapters of the northern and eastern regions, those of Woodbury tend to be less fortified and more concerned with agriculture and the virtues of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prosperity\" title=\"Prosperity\">prosperity</a>. Perhaps as a consequence, they tend to be a little wealthier than their counterparts in other parts of the territory.

Once entirely forested, the woodlands have slowly been felled until only <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Greatwood\">Greatwood</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Woodwych\">Woodwych</a> are still covered and within a few generations it is likely the trees of Woodwych will be gone as well. Still, the scattered hills and low mountain peaks of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrwatch\">Syrwatch</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Mareholm\">Mareholm</a> are rich with mines and quarries that show no signs of running out any time soon. In addition to fine marble, gold, and silver, Casinea produces excellent quality <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Weltsilver\" title=\"Materials\">weltsilver</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Tempest_Jade\" title=\"Materials\">tempest jade</a>, and precious stones have been mined here for centuries. Several wealthy chapters protect the quarries and mines to ensure the protection of the vital assets against barbarians and bandits.</p><p>Modern Casinea is reasonably peaceful - at least on the surface. Behind the tranquil fa\u00e7ade there are still echoes of conflict from events that happened centuries ago. Recent threats from the Druj and the creatures of Broc\u00e9liande, have brought some old disagreements bubbling back to the surface. The fallout from political events at Anvil have inspired other chapters to take a closer look at Highguard's role in the Empire - and at their own role within their nation.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_Turbulent_History\">A Turbulent History</span></h3><p>Casinea has a turbulent history. The first settlers arrived here shortly after the Highborn arrived on the shores of the Bay of Catazar, but the territory was not completely conquered for several decades. The Highborn focused primarily on civilizing <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis\" title=\"Necropolis\">Pharos</a>, and then securing the frontier in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion\" title=\"Bastion\">Bastion</a>. Casinea was heavily forested, a wilderness dominated by savage orcs who fought viciously against human settlers. Eventually tiring of raids from the north-west the patricians turned their attention to the rich woodlands and mobilized their armies to deal with the barbarians as they had dealt with those in Pharos and Bastion, They were only partially successful. Even after the eastern regions were conquered, bands of scattered orcs remained to harass settlers - indeed there are reports of orc raiders attacking into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Casfall\">Casfall</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrwatch\">Syrwatch</a> as late as 150YE.</p><p>After the armies came the settlers. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Casfall\">Casfall</a> (originally called <i>Newland</i>) was quickly dominated by farms and timberyards. Within a generation, construction began on the fortification in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Mareholm\">Mareholm</a> that would protect against the orc presence in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a>. While clearing forest and finding stone and metal in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrwatch\">Syrwatch</a> (or <i>Northwood</i> as it was then), scouts discovered the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#The_Pool_of_Syrene\" title=\"Casinea\">Pool of Syrene</a>, and the powerful Tutamen patrician family claimed the region. Their claim was contested by the Kehment family, and political wrangling eventually boiled over into armed aggression. Some historians point to this short-lived conflict as the first real sign of the corruption beginning to take root in the patrician families. The Tutamen were ultimately victorious, leaving the Kehment broken and bitter - they would eventually quit Highguard altogether for the nascent city of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos\" title=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</a> to the west. The Tutamen moved their entire household to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrene.27s_Wisdom\">Syrene's Wisdom</a>, and renamed the entire region after their patrician. Their presence the pace of colonization - in the east at least. While the woods were slowly cleared from Syrwatch, Mareholm, and Newland, the western woods remained wild and completely unsettled until the time of the Revelation.</p><p>When the Virtuous first began to abandon the heartlands of Highguard, a significant majority built their chapters on the frontier. For most this meant Bastion, but several chapters were established in western Mareholm and Newland. A handful of the most <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambition\" title=\"Ambition\">Ambitious</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Courage\" title=\"Courage\">Courageous</a>, however, sought the freedom to expand into the western woods. Several wanted isolation not only from the corrupt patricians, but even from other chapters - the solitude necessary to explore their relationship with the virtues without distractions. These rugged chapters carved out demesnes from the woods, driving the remaining orcs west and north as they did so. Even today, the chapters of western Casinea have a reputation for being insular and standoffish.</p><p>By the time of the Highborn civil war, then, Casinea was split roughly in two. The eastern regions - Syrwatch, Casfall/Newland, and Mareholm - were settled and prosperous, dominated by the patrician families, and protected by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#The_Silent_Sentinel\">Silent Sentinel</a>. The wild forest regions of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Greatwood\">Greatwood</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Woodwych\">Woodwych</a> were sparsely settled until the first exodus of those who had embraced the Revelation of Virtue. The first battles of the civil war were fought here, as the western chapters fought the patrician armies along the edge their forest in a vicious campaign that eventually saw the virtuous victorious but not without terrible losses on both sides and the near destruction of the Silent Sentinel.</p><p>Following the end of the civil war, Casinea remained a place of conflict. Highborn soldiers fought against <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawn</a> over the northern borders, and with expeditionary forces from the independent cities of Sarvos and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato\" title=\"Tassato\">Tassato</a>, as well as with vallornspawn out of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren\" title=\"Miaren\">Miaren</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande\" title=\"Broc\u00e9liande\">Broc\u00e9liande</a> and orc raiding parties from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a>.

For the most part, the refugees lived as guests of the existing chapters rather than creating their own. Following the final liberation of Reikos in early 380YE, the majority of these exiles chose to return across the border to the east and begin rebuilding their lives.</p><p>While the threat of the Druj in Reikos is ended, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vallorn\" title=\"Vallorn\">vallorn</a> of Broc\u00e9liande remains dangerous.

There are still occasional stories of unnatural creatures in the Greatwood, but the threat of a new vallorn consuming Casinea appears to have ended.</p><p>A little over a year later, however, a second <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Strange_harvest\" title=\"Strange harvest\">major incursion</a> took place. Just after the Summer Solstice, thick clouds of vallorn miasma spread from into Casinea, accompanied by bands of abominable insect-like <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ettercap\" title=\"Ettercap\">ettercaps</a>. They attacked farms and settlements near the outskirts of the dark <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarri</a> forest. The ettercaps were little more than a nuisance, quickly dealt with by the garrison at the Silent Sentinel and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushkan</a> soldiers from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka_military_concerns#The_Northern_Eagle\" title=\"Varushka military concerns\">Northern Eagle</a>. This incursion was only the most obvious symptom of the danger however; reports flooded in of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farm</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forest</a> produce twisted and made unwholesome by the influence of the vallorn. For the most part, the threat was contained and the twisted vegetation destroyed, but some of the plants in Casinea, especially in the north, still bear the mark of the vallorn's corruption.</p><p>Since then, there have been no further threats from the vallorn, but the chapters of Casinea nonetheless keep a wary eye on their north-eastern and eastern borders.

It has not been universally welcomed however; several of the more conservative chapters, especially the insular hermits of the Greatwood, mutter that the road will not only bring merchants but also the lose morality and licentiousness of the League to the heart of Highguard.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anvil\">Anvil</span></h3><p><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Anvil\" title=\"Anvil\">Anvil</a> is the location of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Anvil#The_Senate\" title=\"Anvil\">Senate</a>, and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sentinel_Gate\" title=\"Sentinel Gate\">Sentinel Gate</a>.

Later, it served as a symbol of the power and dominance of the patrician families over the people of the territory. During the civil war, the castle was nearly destroyed in a terrible battle between the remaining patrician garrison and the forces of the virtuous chapters of the western woods. It was rebuilt after the war, returned to its original purpose of protecting the people of Casinea from orc bandits - and to defend against the threat of invasion from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Astolat\" title=\"Astolat\">Astolat</a> to the north.

Situated in the hills west of Anvil, in the shadow of Mount Uphaz, it is guarded by a number of watchtowers and beacons including two structures apparently built by the paragon known as the Sentinel. There are several chapterhouses in and around Syrene, most of whom are dedicated to the study and application of magic, or to exploration of the virtues of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">Vigilance</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wisdom\" title=\"Wisdom\">Wisdom</a>. Syrene is best known however as the location of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#The_Pool_of_Syrene\">Pool of Syrene</a>, which lies at the heart of the town. The pool has powerful, slightly sinister, magical properties and is carefully watched both by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_military_concerns\" title=\"Highguard military concerns\">guardians</a> of Wintergard chapter that oversee it, and by the vigilant members of the other chapters built in and around the town. </p><p>It is tradition in Syrene that no <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Draughir\" title=\"Draughir\">draughir</a> can remain in the settlement for more than three days in any given season. This is in spite of the fact that records show a significantly higher chance of draughir children being born to parents living in Syrene. Draughir are explicitly forbidden to drink or bathe in the waters of the Pool of Syrene and any draughir who are born here are quickly fostered to chapters in other parts of Casinea. This is doubly odd as the town also receives a significant amount of attention from the eternals of the Winter realm who often send their heralds to visit the pools to speak with Imperial citizens. The area seems to hold a particular interest for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sorin\" title=\"Sorin\">Sorin</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wise_Rangara\" title=\"Wise Rangara\">Wise Rangara</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kaela\" title=\"Kaela\">Kaela</a>, each of whom is known as the sovereign of one of the three strong Winter <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> found near Syrene.</p><h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Pool_of_Syrene\">The Pool of Syrene</span></h4><p>The town of Syrene is a quiet community built around a small pool with potent, poorly understood magical properties. The water is fresh, clear, cool, and refreshing. Those who drink it describe the experience as uniquely soothing, allowing them to easily master their emotions and maintain a cool head in the face of provocation. More significantly however, those who bathe in the waters of the pool at least once a week enjoy improved longevity. The pool was jealously guarded by the Tutamen patrician family who carefully controlled access to it; stories from the pre-Imperial times suggest that the patricians of Syrene regularly lived to be a hundred years old, but suffered quick and painful deaths if they ventured too far from the pool that sustained them.</p><p>After the civil war, the magisters and priests of Highguard met to discuss the future of Syrene and came to the conclusion that its magical powers needed to be carefully monitored - there were dangerous unanswered questions about precisely what it was doing. The chapter of Wintergard was established and given custody of the pool. To this day they carefully guard access and Syrene is kept under close scrutiny by both <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Magister\" title=\"Magister\">magisters</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Conclave\" title=\"Imperial Conclave\">Conclave</a>.

Western Casfall is gently wooded - not the wild forests of Woodwych and Greatwood but carefully maintained by the chapters that live there. The trees have more of an air of rolling parkland than wilderness, although there are exceptions of course. Several of the older chapters here are built around the remains of patrician estates, often incorporating much of the original architecture - the estates were quite well fortified for pre-Imperial times given the proximity of the orc-haunted woodlands.</p><p>Originally named <i>Newland</i>, Casfall was renamed in the early days of the Empire. According to stories, Casca herself was a powerful Highborn <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Magister\" title=\"Magister\">magister</a> who was ordered to perform a mighty work of magic to shake the ground beneath the feet of an invading <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orc</a> army. Despite reservations, the ritual went ahead at the command of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a>. Legend has it that she continued to chant even when the power grew too much and the ritual failed, splitting the ground and burying her in the rubble. Her doom is considered a lesson by many magisters in Highguard today, although some disagree about whether the message is that Loyalty must be tempered with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wisdom\" title=\"Wisdom\">Wisdom</a>, or that a magician must understand the high price that some magic claims from its wielder. The settlement of <b>Casca's Fall</b> was built in honour of her around a shrine to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Loyalty\" title=\"Loyalty\">Loyalty</a>, tended to by a small chapter of the same name.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Greatwood\">Greatwood</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b>Forest<br />Perhaps the wildest part of Highguard, the Greatwood has never been densely settled. The few chapterhouses established here tend to be inward looking and insular. Among some of the oldest, they were also some of the last to rally under the banner of the Virtuous Assembly during the civil war - in some parts of Casinea saying someone has \"<i>a Greatwood heart</i>\" is another way of accusing them of being over-cautious. Today the chapters of Greatwood continue to enjoy their privacy and discourage visitors, preferring to pursue their own understanding of the Virtues in relative solitude. A number of the chapters of Greatwood are dedicated to study of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">Vigilance</a> and over the years have provided several Cardinals to the assemblies of both virtues.</p><p>In particular, the chapters here are very reticent to allow any extensive logging of the Greatwood - perhaps understandably as during the civil war the thick woodlands provided additional protection to the chapters here. This reticence exacerbates the brooding tension between the Greatwood chapters and their cousins in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Woodwych\">Woodwych</a>. As far as the Greatwood chapters are concerned, the southern chapters and their League allies covet the ancient trees that grow in the Greatwood and are constantly conniving to find some way to extend their money-hungry lumber businesses into the north. The construction of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lorenzo%27s_Legacy#Blood_Red_Roads\" title=\"Lorenzo's Legacy\">Blood Red Roads</a> in particular is seen as a potential threat to the Casinean way of life - bringing with it as it does an influx of travellers from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a> and even further afield. The chapter of <b>Beacon Ridge</b> has been especially critical of the lack of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">Vigilance</a> in the decision to encourage the intrusion of non-Highborn culture into Casinea.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mareholm\">Mareholm</span></h3><p>For the most part, Mareholm is a relatively quiet, civilized region that has much in common with the more densely settled <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion\" title=\"Bastion\">Bastion</a> to the south-east. The hills and mountains are beautiful and rich with ore, and the soil here is rich and fertile. Defended by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#The_Silent_Sentinel\">Silent Sentinel</a>, many of the chapterhouses here are likewise fortified. This is perhaps understandable - after all, Mareholm is the site of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Anvil\">Anvil</a>, the de facto Imperial capital. Near the Silent Sentinel stands the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Captain_of_the_Throne_Guard#The_Vigilant_Shield\" title=\"Captain of the Throne Guard\">Vigilant Shield</a>, a manor house that serves as he heart of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Captain_of_the_Throne_Guard\" title=\"Captain of the Throne Guard\">Throne Guard</a>.</p><p>The atmosphere here is not entirely peaceful. Until very recently neighbouring <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a> was occupied by vicious <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> invaders. Even with the Druj gone, there are still potential threats to the east. The powerful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vallorn\" title=\"Vallorn\">vallorn</a> haunted forest of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande\" title=\"Broc\u00e9liande\">Broc\u00e9liande</a> broods to the north-east, and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eternal\" title=\"Eternal\">eternal</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Llofir\" title=\"Llofir\">Llofir</a> has claimed bordering <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Tamarbode\" title=\"Reikos\">Tamarbode</a> as part of its domain. While there seems to be no immediate threat from either quarter, the presence of two such unpredictable entities only a short distance from the capital of the Empire gives many cause for concern. There have been <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lonely,_dark_and_deep\" title=\"Lonely, dark and deep\">scattered signs</a> that the Broc\u00e9liande vallorn is not as quiescent as might be hoped, and relations between the Empire and Llofir apparently remain tense.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Syrwatch\">Syrwatch</span></h3><p>Parts of Syrwatch are quite hilly, and have been home to Highborn mining concerns for centuries. The chapters here have a reputation for being rugged, and practical people of a martial bent - the proximity of the border with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawn</a> meant that even in the time of the patricians the people understood the importance of remaining <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">Vigilant</a> not only against orcs but against the ambitions of their fellow humans. A number of the chapters protect <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mineworkings</a>, or enjoy good reputations for making weapons and armour - another reason that Casinea is considered a good place for refitting and resupplying Imperial armies.</p><p>The great quarry of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrene.27s_Wisdom\">Syrene's Wisdom</a> is found in the hills near the small town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Syrene\">Syrene</a>, which is best known as the site of a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#The_Pool_of_Syrene\">magical pool</a> with powerful properties seemingly tied to the Winter realm.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Woodwych\">Woodwych</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />While not as dense as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Greatwood\">Greatwood</a> to the north, Woodwych is still heavily forested. Some of the oldest chapterhouses in Casinea - and by extension, in all of Highguard - were built here in the time before the civil war. Isolated from the patricians by the woodlands - thicker and wilder in pre-Imperial times - the chapters here were some of the first to call for open rebellion in support of the martyred <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Permion\" title=\"Permion\">Permion</a>.</p><p>The region is known both for fine timber and for rich <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Dragonbone\" title=\"Materials\">dragonbone</a> deposits. Several of the chapters of Woodwych maintain extensive <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forest</a> reserves, or make a reasonable profit <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Business\" title=\"Business\">trading</a> along the woodland road that links <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a> to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Casca.E2.80.99s_Doom\">Casca's Doom</a> (and to the rest of Highguard). This trade serves as a source of some tension between the chapters of Woodwych and those of the Greatwood. According to some, the more insular chapters in the north resent the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prosperity\" title=\"Prosperity\">Prosperity</a> enjoyed by their southern cousins, and accuse them of having embraced the \"love of money\" that they say infects the people of the League.</p><div class=\"box\"><div class=\"box-inner\"><b>Woodland Tensions</b><br /><p>It is no secret that relations between some of the older chapters of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Woodwych\">Woodwych</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Greatwood\">Greatwood</a> are cool at best. Obviously, the mutual suspicion is not shared by every chapter in the two regions but it is widespread enough that it is occasionally used as a source of amusement by other Casineans. It most likely traces its roots back to the very beginning of the Virtuous Assembly, when there was a much closer relationship between the chapters of the two woodland regions.</p><p>When <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Permion\" title=\"Permion\">Permion</a> first called for the Virtuous to guide the Highborn, there was significant disagreement between the chapters in the northern and southern forest. The Woodwych chapters broadly supported Permion, and welcomed a chance to help the Navigator to rebuild Highguard. The Greatwood chapters, heeding the cautious voice of the respected Theresa of Beacons Ridge did not agree. Theresa warned that the only possible outcome of an attempt to bring the Virtues to Highguard would be war - that the patricians would never relax their stranglehold on the nation. She was, of course, proved correct. When Permion was murdered, the Woodwych chapters were among the loudest voices calling for war, while again their cousins in the north called for a more cautious response. In the end, the Greatwood chapters joined the war alongside the rest of the Virtuous, but their reticence was neither forgotten nor forgiven.</p><p>In the centuries since, the Woodwych chapters have continued to embrace change. They welcomed trade with the League, and quickly embraced the idea of helping to found the Empire. The northern chapters continue to espouse caution - they were a solid core of opposition in the Highborn Assembly to the idea that Highguard would prosper in a union with \"lesser\" nations. While they grudgingly accept that the world has moved on, members of the insular chapters are often quick to point out the dangers of abandoning reliable tradition in favour of untested novelty.</p>One story that is guaranteed to inflame the disagreement between the chapters of western Casinea is that of the supposed \"secret weirwood grove\" that exists somewhere in Greatwood. The source of the rumour has never been pinned down, but several times there have been accusations of a conspiracy among several of the Greatwood chapters to conceal the existence of such a grove - that it is the real source of their reticence to allow their rich woodlands to be cut. No proof of this hidden Bourse resource has ever been presented.</div></div><div style=\"float: right; width=300px; margin-right:10px; margin-left: 10px; clear: right;\"><table><tr><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Summit</th><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Elected</th></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 383YE</td><td>Lev of the Unbound</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 382YE</td><td>Alys of the Woodwych Harts</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 381YE</td><td>Nira of Cantiarch's Hold</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 380YE</td><td>Barrabas</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 379YE</td><td>Zephram of Cantiarchs Hold</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 378YE</td><td>Zephram of Cantiarchs Hold</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 377YE</td><td>Zephram of Cantiarchs Hold</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 376YE</td><td>Cyrus of Felix' Watch</td></tr></table></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_Senate_Elections\">Recent Senate Elections</span></h2><p>As an Imperial territory, Casinea is represented by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> elected in the Autumn.

                "description": "<p>Necropolis is a land of sorrow, first and foremost. Poets wax lyrical about the sad grandeur of the landscape, but even the least sensitive sometimes have to suppress a cold realisation of their own mortality. Yet the sorrow of Necropolis is tempered with the knowledge that <i>all</i> things pass - that sorrows teach valuable lessons, and that loss is part of life. Even the most bustling chapterhouse in Necropolis will contain some <i>memento mori</i>, some little touch that is ignored consciously but that subconsciously reminds them every day that people die. </p><p>The first Highborn settled along the coast of the Bay of Catazar here, and some of the oldest post-Terunael human-built structures are found here. In some ways, it is the foundation upon which Highguard - and to a degree the Empire - was built.</p><p>When the Highborn arrived, the entire area that is now Highguard was controlled by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a>. As they established themselves, the newly arrived humans drove the orcs north and east - eventually eliminating the majority of the orc nations and forcing the rest to flee toward <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Mallum\" title=\"The Mallum\">the Mallum</a>. Fragmentary records of the time talk to the conflict this created with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a> as the spreading Highborn kingdom drove angry orcs to attack <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Therunin\" title=\"Therunin\">Therunin</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt\" title=\"Redoubt\">Redoubt</a>. The early diplomatic incidents this created soured relations with the two \"native\" human cultures for several decades.</p><p>This first territory the Highborn conquered they called <i>Pharos</i>, and built a great city here to serve as their capital. The city of Pharos was burnt to the ground during the time of turmoil, the civil war between the patricians and the chapters. Yet Pharos was not the only victim of the war - a number of towns and early chapters were destroyed by one side or the other. Many were never rebuilt, serving as permanent memorials to, and warnings against, the most tragic period in the history of Highguard. Following the war, many citizens chose to establish chapters in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea\" title=\"Casinea\">Casinea</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion\" title=\"Bastion\">Bastion</a>, beginning new lives and putting the memories of a vicious internal conflict behind them. As a result, Necropolis had the lowest population of all the Highborn territories - at least until the invasion of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a> by the Druj.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>The most significant event in the last hundred years was most likely the problems with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Grendel\" title=\"Grendel\">Grendel</a> raids in the early 300s. These were dealt with decisively during the reign of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Deanne\" title=\"Empress Deanne\">Empress Deanne</a> - parts of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Sanctuary_Sand\">Sanctuary Sand</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Longbeach\">Longbeach</a> are still marked by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orc</a> attempts to secure the territory. These attacks petered out over the course of her reign, and had largely ended by the time <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Ahraz\" title=\"Emperor Ahraz\">Emperor Ahraz</a> took the throne. </p><p>Recent years have seen increasing Grendel action, and the threat to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Longbeach\">Longbeach</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Sanctuary_Sand\">Sanctuary Sand</a> is all-too-real. The Empire has taken pains to try and ensure there is an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_army\" title=\"Imperial army\">army</a> garrisoned along the southern coast as much as possible - the Grendel would no doubt relish the opportunity to pillage the tombs of the Thrones and heroes of the Empire. Fortunately, they cannot directly assault the Necropolis itself - the cliffs protect the city from marine assaults.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Necropolis\">The Necropolis</span></h3><p>At the mouth of the river Couros lies Bastion\u2019s shadowed twin, a mausoleum in black marble. The Black City is a mirror of the White City to the north, but where Bastion is full of life and a symbol of the pride and future of the Highborn, Necropolis is a silent, sombre memorial to the past. Built in the ruins of Pharos after its destruction during the civil war, the tombs have spread to encompass almost all the old ruins. Scattered throughout the ruins are mausoleums built to house the Highborn dead. To many Highborn it is as if the city itself has been entombed, its memory preserved in the house of the dead.</p><p>The Necropolis holds the bodies of the Empire\u2019s heroes, along with the Imperial Histories, guarded eternally by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_religious_beliefs#Stewards_of_the_dead\" title=\"Highguard religious beliefs\">stewards of the dead</a>. The legendary mausoleum has become the final resting place of almost every Emperor and Empress. In death, all Highborn desire to be lain to rest here, amongst the heroes of the past, where the stewards watch eternally over their silent graves. It is a tremendous honour for heroes of other Imperial Nations to be offered a final resting place alongside them. Those who would be heroes know that granite \u2013 and the words placed upon it \u2013 will endure long after their flesh has faded.</p><p>Preserved and maintained by several chapters with strong connections to the stewards, the permanent population of Necropolis is tiny compared to the area it covers. Some of these chapters are dedicated to preserving a single tomb, or the tombs of all the dead from a specific era or nation. Even for Highborn chapters, these chapters have a reputation for being dour, grim and restrained. \"Only the dead live in Necropolis\" is a common, if somewhat disrespectful, saying about the Black City. </p><p>There are a great many point of interest in Necropolis but the majority are tombs or memorials to the dead. One of the best known memorials, outside the tombs of the emperors and empresses, are <b>the Silent Obelisks</b>, scattered here and there throughout the city. Each is roughly the same - an obelisk of black granite surrounded by a small memorial garden - and each bears the names of every known Imperial soldier who has laid down their life in a significant conflict against the enemies of the Empire. In each case, a small shrine is maintained by a dedicated steward of the dead that serves in the role of a museum - decorated with plaques and friezes that chronicle the conflict, and containing carefully chosen relics of the past war. The Obelisks sometimes attract criticism, especially from the Urizen, as they record history with a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_history#Archivists\" title=\"Highguard history\">distinctly Highborn flavour</a> that favours inspiring lessons over strict adherence to facts. Not every conflict the Empire has ever fought is recorded here - which has in the past been a source of additional criticism. A small number of the obelisks have suffered damage over the centuries, but only one has ever been damaged through malice. In 228YE a cabal of heretics lead by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mikkal\" title=\"Mikkal\">false exemplar</a> marred one of the oldest obelisks - the obelisk memorialising those slain in the war against <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Alderei_the_Fair\" title=\"Alderei the Fair\">Alderei the Fair</a>. While the obelisk was partially restored, roughly a third of the names were lost beyond recovery.</p><p>While it is a respected repository of historical knowledge, Necropolis survived the rampage of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Nicovar\" title=\"Emperor Nicovar\">Emperor Nicovar</a> largely unscathed. While he was merciless in regard to the libraries and centres of learning elsewhere in the Empire, he spared the memorial shrines of Necropolis. That is not to say that he did not come here; his forces destroyed the <b>Hall of Chronicles</b>, a library dedicated primarily to the biographies of the dead. A surprising number of the actual documents survived this attempted purge however. In addition to those texts smuggled out when it was clear that an attack was imminent, magical means were used to preserve a number of the most valuable books. Even while the building was being burnt a dedicated coven of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Magister\" title=\"Magister\">magisters</a> evoked powerful Winter magic to place protective enchantments against fire on many of the texts. While the magicians themselves perished in the blaze, the books survived unscathed. Unfortunately, their magic had not gone unnoticed. After the destruction, Nicovar's forces searched the rubble for three days and found many of the undamaged texts and tore them apart. Still, not everyone was as committed to the destruction of the library as the mad Emperor - and as a result, fragments and individual pages - as well as entire books - occasionally turn up in the possession of descendants of these soldiers.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Necropolis is one of the most haunted locations in the Empire. The stewards maintain careful vigilance for hauntings, and for the rare occasions where an unliving creature emerges from one of the tombs. The traditional approach is to make cautious contact and discover the purpose of the haunting. Ghosts invariably are brought back by some unfinished business, or terrible wrong that needs righting, and the stewards are experts at working out how to do this. Violence and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Religious_skills#Exorcism\" title=\"Religious skills\">exorcism</a> are seen as a last resort: better to help a poor soul into the Labyrinth than to risk destroying it.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Litharge\">The Litharge</span></h3><p>This single-storey building sprawls across a cemetery in the north of the Necropolis, and is the premier Imperial college specifically devoted to the study of death. Priests come here to study the funeral rites not only of the Empire, but of the entire world. Obviously, they have large stores of lore related to Imperial funeral ceremonies, but they also have extensive information about the rites of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Faraden\" title=\"Faraden\">Faraden</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Iron_Confederacy\" title=\"Iron Confederacy\">Iron Confederacy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Asavean_Archipelago\" title=\"Asavean Archipelago\">Asavean Archipelago</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarcophan_Delves\" title=\"Sarcophan Delves\">Sarcophan Delves</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sumaah_Republic\" title=\"Sumaah Republic\">Sumaah Republic</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Principalities_of_Jarm\" title=\"Principalities of Jarm\">Principalities of Jarm</a>.

Several covens of magisters proficient in the magic of Winter study here, and often support the priests in their work. </p><p>It is customary to speak only in whispers in Litharge, out of respect for the dead, and even lectures are given quietly. The priests who study here maintain several shrines of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambition\" title=\"Ambition\">Ambition</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">Vigilance</a>, but the college is hardly a place of pilgrimage.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"First_Sentinel\">First Sentinel</span></h3><p><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Highrod\">Highrod</a> contains one of the oldest human-built structures in Highguard - and perhaps the Empire. The <i>first</i> First Sentinel was a fortification built in the first days after the Highborn arrived on these shores. Constructed to help secure the northern borders of the first Highborn kingdom against the orc barbarians in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion\" title=\"Bastion\">Bastion</a>. Later, when the Highborn began to expand, it was from the First Sentinel that the armies went forth. While the structure looks tiny compared to modern fortifications, the ruins still show all the expertise of the Highborn siege engineers, using the same effective techniques that they have honed over centuries and still employ today.</p><p>The castle endured until the civil war, during which it was severely damaged during a bitter conflict between an occupying force loyal to the patricians, and three chapters of grim-faced cataphracts. The castle was re-purposed as a military academy, training generations of Highborn commanders. In 77YE, the structure was gutted by a fire that raged out of control for three days; historians are divided as to the cause. Most claim that the fire started when a candle was knocked over in one of the cellars, but a few point to fragmentary accounts about the fire that suggest the involvement of supernatural forces - perhaps even an eternal such as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Thrice-cursed_Court#Surut\" title=\"The Thrice-cursed Court\">Surut</a>. After its destruction, the ruins were troubled by the ghosts of the dead soldiers, and a team of exorcists worked year-round to lay them each to rest while also trying to piece together the story of the fire. In the end, the shell of the structure was partially reconstructed, but repurposed again as a place of pilgrimage and shrine dedicated to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambition\" title=\"Ambition\">Ambition</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Courage\" title=\"Courage\">Courage</a> of not only those Highborn who died in the fire, but those who defended their people or marched to war to build a better future. </p><p>Some Highborn point to First Sentinel as an metaphor for Highguard; while they can adapt to the times, their core identity endures, and remains unchanged. A popular heresy, however, suggests that First Sentinel is not simply a metaphor for the state of Highguard but in some ways a spiritual or magical \"barometer\" of its fortunes. They point to so-called significant events such as the multiple expansions during the initial conquest of what is today Highguard; or certain incidents during the civil war. They claim that its destruction by fire and return as a spiritual place of pilgrimage reflected the Highguard finding their new identity within the Empire.

The wayhouse was built in 1YE by members of Myfanwy's striding - partially to commemorate the story, but primarily because its position at the point where the three major roads diverge both makes it a healthy business, and gives the Navarr access to a great many people potentially in need of their aid.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hedrossan\">Hedrossan</span></h3><p>The river Couros is navigable for much of its length, allowing riverboats to travel up past <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion\" title=\"Bastion\">Bastion</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt\" title=\"Redoubt\">Redoubt</a> to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Haros_Water\" title=\"Reikos\">Haros</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a>, as well as to reach parts of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow\" title=\"Morrow\">Morrow</a>.

According to Highborn historians, the common refreshing drink of lemonade was invented here in the early days after the Highborn arrived. This claim has been contested, but the fact remains that the best lemons in the Empire come from Highrod, generated perhaps by the unusually hot summers and cold winters that the local chapterhouses endure with pride. It is also known for containing one of the oldest human-built structures in Highguard - and perhaps the Empire - the remains of the <b><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#First_Sentinel\">First Sentinel</a></b>, a fortification built in the first days after the Highborn arrived on these shores.</p><p>The chapters here are almost exclusively built around the margins of the forest rather than at its heart. At the time of the civil war, the woodlands here had been extensively harvested by the Highborn. After Pharos burned, however, the woodlands were allowed to grow wild again, to cover over several especially bitter battlefields. According to local legend, the woods are haunted by the unquiet spirits of the Patrician's soldiers who died here in great numbers during the civil war. Occasionally, travelers encounter ivy-choked ruins in Highrod, the shattered remnants of Patrician palaces and villas, several of which have their own unpleasant spectres associated with them that prove particularly resistant to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Exorcism\" title=\"Exorcism\">exorcism</a>.

It is perhaps best known for the port-town of <b>Crown's Quay</b>. Once a small fishing village called Westport, Crown\u2019s Quay became notable as the preferred port for those wishing to travel to Anvil, and its docks were rebuilt by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Military_Council\" title=\"Imperial Military Council\">military council</a> in the early days of Empire. Legend also says that it was the place the Three Sisters, the founders of the Brass Coast, took ship. Despite its age and fame, it has never been especially prosperous as a trade port - although several attempts have been made to built lighthouses and to upgrade the quayside they have rarely amounted to significant change. One point of interest at Crown's Quay is the unassuming building that serves as the offices for overseeing the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs\" title=\"Imperial Orcs\">Imperial orc</a> national <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Bourse\" title=\"Imperial Bourse\">Bourse Seat</a> known as the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steel_Fist\" title=\"Steel Fist\">Steel Fist</a>.

Third, the wide roads helped connect the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Therunin\" title=\"Therunin\">Therunin</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow\" title=\"Morrow\">Morrow</a> with the rest of the Empire and several towns grew up to cater to the needs of merchants and pilgrims. Fourth, the beauty of Reikos itself made the territory wealthy - the great gardens, sweeping estates and peaceful surroundings made it a favourite place for Imperial citizens from across the Empire to convalesce after illness, or to spend time away for the cares of everyday life.</p><p>For centuries, the only real threat to the peace of Reikos came from the abominable inhabitants of the dark forest of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande\" title=\"Broc\u00e9liande\">Broc\u00e9liande</a>. All of this changed in 367YE with the arrival of the Druj.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:CantiarchToWar.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"CantiarchToWar.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/9/93/CantiarchToWar.jpg/450px-CantiarchToWar.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/9/93/CantiarchToWar.jpg/675px-CantiarchToWar.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/9/93/CantiarchToWar.jpg/900px-CantiarchToWar.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">Cantiarch's Hold marching to war.</div></div><p>The downfall of Reikos came from its border with the Great Forest of Peytaht. At its edges, the Great Forest is an abundant source of lumber; but its heart is wild and untamed. The long border with the dark forest was notoriously hard to defend, despite the efforts of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilance\" title=\"Vigilance\">vigilant</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapter\" title=\"Chapter\">chapters</a> such as the <i><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_chapters#Grey_Watchers_of_Peytaht\" title=\"Prominent chapters\">Grey Watchers of Peytaht</a></i>, but at least the forest was equally hostile to human and orc alike. When the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> barbarians launched a surprise attack through the forest in 367YE, the Highborn were woefully unprepared for it. Those chapters on the edge of the forest that did not retreat were overwhelmed in the first few months of the attack. </p><p>The Druj quickly spread south, overwhelming the disorganised Imperial defences. The focus of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Military_Council\" title=\"Imperial Military Council\">Military Council</a> was elsewhere, and by the time the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/General\" title=\"General\">generals</a> could coordinate their <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_army\" title=\"Imperial army\">armies</a>, the territory had already fallen. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Hugh\" title=\"Emperor Hugh\">Emperor Hugh</a> is said to have taken the loss of Reikos particularly badly, and campaigned to focus all Imperial resources on recovering it - unsuccessfully. The Military Council and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Senate</a> had more pressing concerns facing a major mobilization of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a>..</p><p>Many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Benefactor\" title=\"Benefactor\">benefactors</a> were ruined in the attack, and many more are still struggling to restore their fortunes. The gardens, parks and pleasant villages of Reikos were largely unprepared to face the onslaught of the Druj, and hundreds died in the initial attacks before they were able to take refuge in the fortified <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapter\" title=\"Chapter\">chapter houses</a>. The presence of refugees complicated matters severely; several northern chapters fell prey to disease and starvation. The malicious tactics of the Druj served to make the situation even words - they regularly poisoned supplies; publicly tortured and displayed the horribly abused corpses of captured <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_military_concerns\" title=\"Highguard military concerns\">guardians</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_religious_beliefs\" title=\"Highguard religious beliefs\">priests</a>; crippled and maimed Highborn refugees then allowed them to flee so that their presence would further damage morale and absorb valuable medical supplies. Slowly but surely they pressed their advantage and drove the Highborn defenders southward.</p><p>Finally, in Autumn 377YE the Druj mounted a major offensive against the surviving Highborn chapters in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Riverwatch\">Riverwatch</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Haros\">Haros</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Tabernacle\">Tabernacle</a>. The last regions of the territory fell beneath this assault, leaving only a scattered handfuls of fortified chapters as guttering beacons of hope in a sea of dread. it took some time for the Empire to rally after this defeat, but in Winter 378YE a combined Highborn and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> force <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/378YE_Winter_Solstice_winds_of_war#The_garden_of_Highguard\" title=\"378YE Winter Solstice winds of war\">crossed back into Reikos</a> to begin the liberation. It was here that the Imperial soldiers gained first-hand experience of something that would later be referred to as the <i><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj_miasma\" title=\"Druj miasma\">Druj miasma</a></i>  or the <i> shroud of dread</i>.</p><p>After a few skirmishes and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/379YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Blood_and_Stone\" title=\"379YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">liberation of the Vigilant Swan</a>, the Druj forces in the area - represented by a single clan referred to as the Stone Toads, withdrew into the massive fortification they had built in the ruins of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#High_Chalcis\">High Chalcis</a>. They left guerillas, traps and ambushers to harry the Imperial troops while they remained secure behind the great white granite walls of Urith Barath.</p><p>The territory was rejuvenated - and reconfigured - by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/A_season_of_mushrooms\" title=\"A season of mushrooms\">wave of Spring magic</a> that swept Reikos in early 380YE. The magic saw the restoration of great swathes of forest, and the eradication of much of the lingering taint of Druj occupation - but it was not without cost. Drawing on the power of the eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Llofir\" title=\"Llofir\">Llofir</a>, the magic tore apart damaged and ruined structures without concern as to who had built them. The Highborn were able to protect some of their most valuable relics, but a great many damaged buildings were destroyed - including many chapterhouses. As the magic ebbed away, the eternal claimed the region of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Tamarbode\">Tamarbode</a> as its own demesne, until it was ultimately forced to withdraw back to its own realm in the Summer of 383YE.</p><p>The establishment of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Gardens_of_High_Chalcis\" title=\"Gardens of High Chalcis\">Gardens of High Chalcis</a>, coinciding as it did with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Iron_and_wine\" title=\"Iron and wine\">coronation message</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Lisabetta\" title=\"Empress Lisabetta\">Empress Lisabetta</a>, has seen an influx of healers and doctors into the territory - triggering a drive to see Reikos established as the centre for the healing arts in the Empire.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><p><span id=\"Urith_Barath_.28High_Chalcis.29\"></span><span id=\"Urith_Barath\"></span><span id=\"High_Chalcis\"></span></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"High_Chalcis\">High Chalcis</span></h3><p>Prior to the Druj invasion, <b>High Chalcis</b> was one of the largest settlements in Highguard. Built on the hills of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Chalcis_Mount\">Chalcis Mount</a>, and famous for its beautiful gardens, the town was a centre for healing and the study of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Surgical_skills#Apothecary\" title=\"Surgical skills\">apothecary</a> arts where the medical knowledge of the Empire was codified and expanded. The settlement fell to surprise attack in 367YE, the storehouses of knowledge raided, and the great Stone Toad fortress of <b>Urith Barath</b> built among the ruins. The Druj citadel fell to Imperial forces in Autumn 379YE, but little remained of the original town in the wake of the destruction. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/A_season_of_mushrooms\" title=\"A season of mushrooms\">powerful Spring magic</a> that washed away signs of Druj occupation devoured most of the remaining ruin.</p><p>In the wake of this destruction, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Construct_Gardens_of_High_Chalcis\" title=\"Construct Gardens of High Chalcis\">extensive work</a> was undertaken to restore the town, and especially the Gardens that once surrounded it. New chapterhouses were established around the one structure still standing - the miraculously restored <b>Shining Towers</b>. These four beautiful towers appeared shortly after the destruction of the Druj citadel on the site of the old chapterhouse of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_chapters#The_Shattered_Tower\" title=\"Prominent chapters\">Shattered Tower</a>. Returned at last from exile, the Shattered Tower have claimed the towers as their new chapterhouse. They report that not only do the towers surround a weak Summer <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a>, but that they seem to be composed of the legendary magical material <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Stalwart_Stand_on_Solid_Ground#The_Nature_of_Adamant\" title=\"Stalwart Stand on Solid Ground\">adamant</a>. In some parts of the territory has become a symbol of the unbreakable will of the people of Reikos. In the gardens around the towers stands the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Keeper_of_the_Cox#Grove_of_Golden_Cox\" title=\"Keeper of the Cox\">Grove of Golden Cox</a>, famed for its unique apple tree that produces <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vis#Golden_Apples\" title=\"Vis\">Golden Apples</a> rich with Summer <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vis\" title=\"Vis\">vis</a>.</p><p>In the year since, the settlement has seen a remarkable spate of growth, heavily supported by Highborn exiles returning from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Therunin#Peakedge_Song\" title=\"Therunin\">Peakedge Stead</a> in neighbouring <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Therunin\" title=\"Therunin\">Therunin</a> and their <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> allies. One of the more important structures is the beautiful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Claviger_of_the_Basilica_of_Cora_Holdfast#Basilica_of_Cora_Holdfast\" title=\"Claviger of the Basilica of Cora Holdfast\">Basilica of Cora Holdfast</a>, completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox 381YE.

Today, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_work\" title=\"Great work\">great work</a> they represent has been restored, and the Chalcis Hills once again bloom with a great bounty of healing herbs, providing a great boon to the physicks and apothecaries of Reikos.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Sign_of_Tamar\">The Sign of Tamar</span></h3><p>This vast sigil incised into the plain in northern Reikos predates the first human settlements in Reikos. Created by digging long trenches in the earth, scholars have never been sure who constructed it, what purpose (if any) it served, or when precisely it was built. Scholars have paced out the sigil and drawn it, and declared it a humanoid figure that matches the constellation called <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Drowned_Man\" title=\"The Drowned Man\">the Drowned Man</a>. There is some evidence that the sign is part of, or  contains, a very potent Spring <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a>, possibly with an affinity for the darker and more destructive uses of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spring_magic\" title=\"Spring magic\">Spring magic</a>.

Historians have also speculated extensively about how Tamar may have been, and why the region as a whole is called Tamarbode - it is assumed they were connected in some way with the original conquest of Reikos during the early Empire, but there are no records to support this or details of exactly who they may have been.</p><p>The eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Llofir\" title=\"Llofir\">Llofir</a> claimed the Sign of Tamar, as it claimed the whole of Tamarbode. The sigil itself disappeared beneath the enchanted forest that now covers the entire region. Even with the liberation of Tamarbode in 383YE, the earthworks that made up the sign continued to be overgrown and there is every chance it will simply be reclaimed by nature.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Great_Forest_at_Reikos\">The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_Forest_at_Reikos\" title=\"Great Forest at Reikos\">Great Forest at Reikos</a></span></h3><p>The Great Forest at Reikos is a Bourse resource that covers the eastern hills of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Broken_Ride\">Broken Ride</a>.

A square, stocky building of white stone, it is surrounded by a quiet park laid out with every attempt made to create a quiet atmosphere of contemplation and reflection. Within the structure itself, the dead of Reikos are interred or memorialised, and many relics of the past history of Reikos are kept here - primarily those from before the Druj invasion, but with at least a few connected to heroic deeds performed during the conquest, the occupation, and the later liberation. In particular, the top floor of the Ossuary contains a library where stories from the occupation are stored. Harrowing tales of despair and courage, they include many journals written by those who fell to the orcs.</p><p>Work on the Ossuary was already underway when the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/A_season_of_mushrooms\" title=\"A season of mushrooms\">great wave of Spring magic</a> swept over the territory - magic that destroyed the remains of the dead as easily as it expunged the lingering mark of the Druj occupation. Only the desperate action of a dozen independent captains and their <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Military_unit\" title=\"Military unit\">retinues</a> prevented the Ossuary being overwhelmed.

It was financed by the Beneficent Order of Steel Chain in conjunction with several Highborn <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Benefactor\" title=\"Benefactor\">benefactors</a>.  The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Opportunity\" title=\"Opportunity\">opportunity</a> to construct the Hall arose as a result of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/In_brightest_day#The_Power_to_Exalt\" title=\"In brightest day\">inspiration</a> following in the wake of powerful magic that washed across the Empire prior to the Winter Solstice 380YE. A place of pilgrimage, the Hall is dedicated to the history of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapter\" title=\"Chapter\">chapters</a> who have fallen in service of the Empire and the nation. Built in the newly reborn town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Riverwatch\">Tabernacle</a>, the hall is located on the original high street in Tabernacle, covering multiple lots that were reduced to rubble during the invasion. The Unbound Steel Hall is the largest structure currently standing on the site of the old settlement. It will be several years before Tabernacle is restored to its former glory but the presence of the Hall, and the pilgrims it attracts, are both certain to help with that process.</p><p>Pilgrims seeking solace in the lessons of the past first walk through a covered colonnade that winds through a park of a labyrinthine design. In the middle of the park stands a tall granite bell tower. The bells do not tell the time, but instead are sounded the time and day when each Chapter had fallen to the Druj. Arriving at the main building, the visitors are greeted by an imposing portico with massive columns, giving weight to what lies beyond. Passing the entrance, the pilgrims enter a cloister dominated by a huge statue of a basilisk - the protector of the place. </p><p>On the north side, the cloister lies against a basilica that serves as a place for contemplation and meditation. The vast space inside is filled with large banners of all the chapters symbols bound into a greater whole by the single endless steel chain that gives the hall its name. On the east side of the cloister, the Wing of Memory preserves the chapter relics and memorabilia that were recovered after Llofir\u2019s season of mushrooms. Very little sound filters through from the outside as if the building itself demanded a quiet respect for the fallen. The wing also houses a large collection of scrolls, cared for by the archivists. The scrolls contain stories of the chapters, both grand and subtle, their culture and teachings, and their legacies. Opposite, in the Chamber of Murmurs, the stewards recite the names of the dead without pause day and night and they do not repeat themselves for many days.

Built in a classical Highborn style, a number of smaller white granite buildings surround a single tall tower - Obadiah Spire - which provides the best view of the surrounding countryside. The Seminary ensures that students of a priestly background understand  magic, while those of a more magical bent have a sufficiently Orthodox understanding of the Way. </p><p>It is an austere place of study, that demands much of its students  and provides little in the way of comfort. To remove distractions the Students are forbidden to set foot on the mainland while they are engaged in their studies. The most common diversion for bored students is to take shallow boats out onto the lake. Eight boats are moored at a small quay beneath the seminary, each named by one of the \"<a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Benefactor\" title=\"Benefactor\">Benefactors</a> of Highguard\" who helped complete the seminary; the Pride of Reikos; Naomi\u2019s Vigilance; Adoraims Ambitious Ravens; Asael\u2019s Boon; the Wings of Courage; the Doctors Loyalty; Highborn Virtue; and The Silence of Atun.</p><p>The training of new magicians requires a regular supply of crystal mana, thus creating a steady stream of income for the mana sites of Reikos.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Remember_Exile\">Remember Exile</span></h3><p>Completed just before the Autumn Equinox 381YE through the use of a potent enchantment, this fortification is built in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Broken_Ride\">Broken Ride</a>.

These isolated chapters were easy prey for the Druj when they invaded.</p><p>In 369 YE, the woods were the site of the massacre at <b>Exile</b>. Built round a chapter of Unconquered who trained in the solitude provided by the deep woods, Exile was a hard place, and the Highborn there embraced many trials designed to harden the soul. They held out for three years before they were finally overrun. The Druj desecrated the dead, and used their remains to construct one of their grim shrines of fear and despair, responsible for helping to spread a foul <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj_miasma\" title=\"Druj miasma\">miasma</a> over the entire territory.</p><p>In the last days of the siege, the choice to hold against overwhelming odds or leave with honour was given to all of the recruits, not a one of whom chose to leave.

The Stone Toad clan built their ciradel of Urith Barath here, and it was from that citadel that they ruled Reikos with an iron fist; the citadel is gone now. </p><p>Chalcis Mount has a noticeably high population of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> residents.

They have established a small settlement on the edge of the region no more than a days march from the steading.</p><p>Outside High Chalcis, the physicks and apothecaries are beginning to return. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos_Spoils_of_War#Fields_of_Remembrance\" title=\"Reikos Spoils of War\">Fields of Remembrance</a> in particular stand as a reminder of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Courage\" title=\"Courage\">Courage</a> of those who fought to defend, and to free, Reikos. Perhaps just as significantly, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mine</a> known as the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos_Spoils_of_War#The_Wound_of_Chalcis\" title=\"Reikos Spoils of War\">Wound of Chalcis</a> is in business once again, drawing up fine quality <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Weltsilver\" title=\"Materials\">weltsilver</a> from the dark stone cliffs overlooking Therunin.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Grey_Charge\">Grey Charge</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The wide plains of Grey Charge were avoided by the Druj themselves, but given over to the control of one of their brutal subject nations. The scattered chapterhouses were turned into twisted orc settlements, and the human populace reduced to the status of field slaves. After the liberation, the Spring magic devoured all the ruined chapters, villages, and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> that once stood here leaving behind untouched forest. New chapters are being established here by the survivors, looking to the trees as a source of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prosperity\" title=\"Prosperity\">Prosperity</a>.

They actively support rebuilding efforts across the entire territory.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Haros_Water\">Haros Water</span></h3><p>Haros Water takes its name from the tributary of the Couros that runs through it. Similar to neighbouring <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Riverwatch\">Riverwatch</a>, Haros Water was made wealthy by a combination of prosperous farms and regular trade passing along the road and the river. The town of <b>Haros</b>, once a major stopping point for trade passing through Reikos, was effectively destroyed during the liberation, and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/A_season_of_mushrooms\" title=\"A season of mushrooms\">tide</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spring_magic\" title=\"Spring magic\">Spring magic</a> that followed after it. Most of the damage had already been done by the time the magic spread over the ruins - following a three day battle in the streets during Winter 378YE, the Druj <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/379YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Blood_and_Stone\" title=\"379YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">fired the town</a>, creating a conflagration that lasted through the night and saw the entire settlement reduced to ruins. The beautiful river gates of Haros, which once allowed daring forays by expert boatmen supporting the defenders, were reduced to broken fragments, standing as mute testimony to the loss of the last Imperial foothold in the territory. </p><p>Not everything is lost. A brave effort by several chapters managed to protect some remnants of the former town from the voracious appetite of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Llofir\" title=\"Llofir\">Llofir</a> and its agents. The ruins of the river gates in particular still stand, providing a memorial to those who died fighting to protect their homes. The only other structure still standing is now the tallest in the new town; the  tower of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos_Spoils_of_War#Echoes_of_Wisdom\" title=\"Reikos Spoils of War\">Echoes of Wisdom</a> bell-makers business survived the fall of Haros, the Druj occupation, and the wave of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spring_magic\" title=\"Spring magic\">Spring magic</a> entirely untouched A new town is beginning to flourish around it, taking advantage of the influx of lumber from the new woodlands of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Grey_Charge\">Grey Charge</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Longshire\">Longshire</a>. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prominent_chapters#The_Suns_of_Couros\" title=\"Prominent chapters\">Suns of Couros</a> in particular have been active in re-establishing Haros. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Draughir\" title=\"Draughir\">Draughir</a> chapter have established a new chapterhouse - a dim reflection of its previous splendour - and are encouraging other Highborn to participate in the rebuilding of Haros as a staging point for the settlement of  western Reikos.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Longshire\">Longshire</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The plains of Longshire were not heavily settled even when Reikos was at its height; now that they are densely wooded this has not noticeably changed. During the occupation, the scattered chapters here were reduced to ruins and claimed by various barbarians. These unruly gangs of orcs squabbled among themselves, occasionally causing the Druj themselves to step in and make an example to restore order. Of particular note is the attack in 370YE when the Druj slaughtered every member of the clan living in the ruins of the old Granite Chain chapterhouse. </p><p>An ambitious band of Unconquered soon took residence in the ruins, exploiting the superstitious dread of the local orcs to maintain a hidden chapterhouse that helped coordinate the resistance in the western territory. Today the chapterhouse has been rebuilt by the surviving Unconquered. Working closely with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Master_of_the_School_of_Exorcism#The_School_of_Exorcism\" title=\"Master of the School of Exorcism\">School of Exorcism</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Riverwatch\">Riverwatch</a>, the chapter works to help lay to rest the remaining wraiths that haunt Longshire and to provide support to new chapters establishing themselves amidst the new grown forests.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Riverwatch\">Riverwatch</span></h3><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vigilant_Swan\" title=\"Vigilant Swan\">Vigilant Swan</a> was the source of a great deal of prosperity for Riverwatch, but a significant amount also came from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> that sprawled across the wide, fertile plains north of the Haros river. As with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Haros_Water\">Haros Water</a>, the region was also made wealthy by trade passing along the road between <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea\" title=\"Casinea\">Casinea</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos\" title=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</a> in the east and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steading\" title=\"Steading\">steadings</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Therunin\" title=\"Therunin\">Therunin</a> to the west. Much of that trade passed through the town of <b>Tabernacle</b>, a well-fortified triple-ringed settlement whose residents sprawled outside its walls in long years of peace. Riverwatch held out against the Druj for a decade, the last site of major resistance to the invaders, with constant skirmishing along its borders that saw the farms devastated and Tabernacle reduced to the status of an armed camp. Riverwatch was the last region of Reikos to fall to the Druj, and even then only after many months of sustained assault. While some chapters survived the fall of Tabernacle, the survivors were forced to retreat across the river to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion#Sybella_Cross\" title=\"Bastion\">Sybella Cross</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bastion\" title=\"Bastion\">Bastion</a>. A year of occupation saw Tabernacle reduced to mud-choked ruins scattered with lethal traps and deadfalls that would have taken months of careful work to locate and disarm. In the end, the town was swallowed by Llofir's wave of Spring magic, devoured by the earth itself, ruins and traps and all.</p><p>Today a village is slowly spreading around Riverwatch, named Tabernacle in memory of the town that once stood here. With trade caravans returning to the pre-occupation routes, the village is enjoying a little of its former prosperity. The re-establishment <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos_Spoils_of_War#Tabernacle_Legacy_Claret\" title=\"Reikos Spoils of War\">Tabernacle Legacy Claret</a> in particular marked the beginning of the new prosperity; built over the extensive hidden cellars of the old vineyard, the wine produced here is said to have a particularly fine if bitter quality and has proved popular in several places damaged by war with the orcs. Further prosperity has been brought by a small family of respectable <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Faraden\" title=\"Faraden\">Faraden</a> traders who have set up a small, permanent enclave in Tabernacle, trading herbs and wood with the citizens of Reikos as they serve as a hub for caravans trading into Therunin and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tamarbode\">Tamarbode</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />The desolate plains of Tamarbode were primarily known as the site of the enigmatic <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#The_Sign_of_Tamar\">Sign of Tamar</a>, and at least one chapter was dedicated to protecting and guarding the eerie earthworks. It was also home to a couple of fortified chapters on the borders of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande\" title=\"Broc\u00e9liande\">Broc\u00e9liande</a>, facing into the forests there and keeping a careful watch on the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vallorn\" title=\"Vallorn\">Vallorn</a> that slumbers fitfully at its heart. Contact with these chapters was lost when the last of them was overrun by Druj in 372YE. During the orc occupation, the region appeared to be under the control of an especially vicious Druj <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj#Magic\" title=\"Druj\">Ghulai</a> nicknamed \"<b>Greenmask</b>\". </p><p>The region was never fully liberated from the Druj - even after the fall of Urith Barath, scattered orc warbands held out here for several months. In Summer 380YE, the great surge of Spring magic that began the rejuvenation of Reikos apparently began here, and the entire region was claimed by the eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Llofir\" title=\"Llofir\">Llofir</a>. Tamarbode became a primeval woodland that thrummed with unruly <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spring_magic\" title=\"Spring magic\">Spring magic</a>, and was largely unknown to Imperial forces. Indeed, there were indications that the woodland might be actively hostile to humans, possibly as a response to an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/380YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#Our_Neighbour.27s_Field\" title=\"380YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">abortive attempt</a> by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Citadel_Guard\" title=\"Citadel Guard\">Citadel Guard</a> to drive out the eternal forces here.</p><p>In the end, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/383YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#Destroying_Angels\" title=\"383YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">combined operation</a> by the Wolves of War and the Towerjacks ultimately destroyed the Castle of Ruin, and Llofir's Garden collapsed and was withdrawn into the Spring Realm.

                "description": "<p>Peering at each other across the fast-flowing Vassa, Tassato is called the Twin City or the Split City. Providing the only easy way to cross the wide and dangerous river, Tassato is a city divided against itself. Tassato was originally two towns, Mestra and Regario, allegedly named for the feuding <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard\" title=\"Highguard\">Highborn</a> siblings who historically <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League_history#Origins_of_the_League\" title=\"The League history\">founded</a> them on either bank of the Vassa. Over time, both towns grew on each bank and the river formed a natural boundary between them. Attempts to build bridges between the cities have always foundered and the people rely on boats and barges to cross the river. Along with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos\" title=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</a>, they quietly seceded from Highguard during that nations' civil war, uniting with their cousins to the south to resist all attempts to bring them back under the Highborn banner.</p><p>The western part of the city is called Tassato Mestra, and the eastern is Tassato Regario. The people on either side of the river are historically rivals, and that historical rivalry occasionally boils up into open conflict. The two cities were unified under the control of Anabela di Regario, a merchant prince who ruled over a century before the creation of the Empire. Anabela was forced to contend with the constant rivalry between the two cities- open battles in the streets between bravos were causing widespread lawlessness and in the end the prince declared a ban on the open carrying of weapons. The ban had the desired effect, damping down the bloodshed although and the rivalry was slowly transformed to verbal banter between the two sides. The ban endured until Tassato joined the Empire and in that time the people became famous for their wordplay, launching quips and insults at each other like arrows.</p><p>Citizens of Tassato generally refer to Regario and Mestra as separate places, while everyone else refers to them as wards or parts of the same city.Today Tassato enjoys an unrivalled reputation as a city where the spoken word is an art-form. Tassatans take a delight in layered meanings, subtexts and unspoken communication. The city has provided several senators famous for their brilliant oratory and representatives from the city are usually regarded as the finest diplomats in the Empire. Of all the people of the League, Tassatans are most likely to view life as a game and they are notorious for their love of intrigue, not just for the sake of advancement but for the sheer pleasure to be had thereby. They regard cunning diplomacy more highly than armed conflict, not because they are peace-loving, but instead because they regard words as a more effective tool than weapons in destroying their enemies - better to set enemies against enemies than to face them yourself. Manipulation is high art here - no surprise that some of the finest <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mountebanks\" title=\"Mountebanks\" class=\"mw-redirect\">mountebanks</a> hail from Tassato.</p><p>Tassato chooses a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> each Autumn equinox, and as might be imagined the election is often bitterly contested. Traditionally, being senator for Tassato is regarded as one of the worst seats in the Imperial Senate. If the senator is from the city itself, then they often encounter resistance and hostility from the folk from the other side of the river. If they are not from the city proper - if they refuse to pick a side - they are generally treated as interlopers and encounter harassment from citizens from both sides of the river. A few wealthy guilds that live outside the city proper maintain a discreet distance from the intrigues of their more urban cousins - the votes of these guilds are much sought after by candidates regardless of where they live.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Bold_Tassatan.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Bold Tassatan.png\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png/500px-Bold_Tassatan.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">Tassato is home to bold bravos, master merchants, divine dramaturges and princes of the League.</div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Sapphire_Stair\">The Sapphire Stair</span></h3><p>A masterwork of locks built by the Tassatan engineer Marco Di Paraiso for Emperor Giovanni in the early days of the empire, replacing the old system of portage.

The school continues to teach spies, diplomats and cartographers, alongside the more traditional accountants,  priests and poets. While it is much smaller than the University of Tassato, and lacks that establishment's depth of curriculum, it is still a prestigious educational establishment. Relations with the University remain cordial, although marked by occasional outbursts of \"student hijinks\" on both sides. </p><p>It also has greater historical and cultural significance than its comparatively small size and focus might suggest, even leaving aside the fact that it was founded by a woman that the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Imperial Synod</a> recognised as a reincarnation of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Paragons_and_Exemplars\" title=\"Paragons and Exemplars\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Exemplar</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kala\" title=\"Kala\">Kala</a>.

Some buildings, especially along the riverfront, stretch to four or even five stories. Architects in Regario may be more technically adept, but builders in Mestra are certainly masters at improvisation and practical application of their skills.</p><p>With the Jotun conquest of the Mournwold, the citizens of Tassato Mestra live constantly under the threat of invasion. The recently completed <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato#La_Redotta_Rezia\">Redotta Rezia</a> will hopefully provide some protection from the armies of barbarian orcs.</p><p>Mestra is also the site of the remarkable new <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Curator_of_the_Printer%27s_Guild_Museum#Printers_Guild_Museum_of_Wonders\" title=\"Curator of the Printer's Guild Museum\">Printers Guild Museum of Wonders</a>.

The Mana Exchange is an economic battleground between several League guilds involved in the mana trade, especially the rival Regarian DeSousa Crystal Traders, and the DeMosca House of Mana (who enjoy a slight home-soil advantage).</p><p>In contrast to the furious business of the Mana Exchange, the Apothecary Clearing House is a little more sedate. A secure warehouse and spacious offices see herb dealers, physicks, and apothecaries from across the western Empire trading in safe, friendly environment for the quality-assured herbs they need. The market is of particular interest to the Mazzarine-starved physicks of the north and the Bladeroot hungry potion-makers of the southern coast</p><p>The hills above the city proper are also the site of several old <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a>.

In the Empire, the first printing presses were designed and built in Tassato Regario, and the first presses were employed here printing religious tracts, scholarly treatises and political manifestos. There are several printers in Regario, and while they may occasionally vie with each other for the right to print a particularly important - or salacious - document there is more than enough work to go round. The eastern part of the city is home to philosophers, agitators, demagogues, poets and scholars from across the Empire who come here to have their work printed and add a distinctly cosmopolitan feel to the city. The University of Tassato can be found here (although it accepts students from both sides of the river and from across the Empire). It is also the site of the prestigious <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato#The_School_of_Epistemology\">School of Epistemology</a>, founded by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Paragons_and_Exemplars\" title=\"Paragons and Exemplars\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Exemplar</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Avigliana_di_Sarvos\" title=\"Avigliana di Sarvos\">Avigliana</a>, combining a centre of learning with a place of worship dedicated to the embrace of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wisdom\" title=\"Wisdom\">Wisdom</a>.</p><p>The eastern city is much less cramped than the western city - it is also surrounded to the east and south by wide parklands often referred to as the <i>Regarian Walls</i>. This public park is tended by a cadre of professional gardeners, and is also home to several fine orchards and vineyards. Once one gets beyond the public areas, there are several jealously guarded <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">preserves</a> where the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Iridescent_Butterfly\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">iridescent butterfly</a> is cultivated. The guilds who control these private preserves are very fond of their privacy and do not appreciate unexpected guests. Several of them have divorced themselves entirely from the politics of the city, barely pay attention to the politics of the League, and have a reputation for being ... odd. At least one of the guilds here is composed entirely of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Naga\" title=\"Naga\">naga</a>, descended from some of the original <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League_lineage_and_species_attitudes#Reckoners\" title=\"The League lineage and species attitudes\">reckoners</a> and rumoured to engage in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Religious_Crimes#Idolatry\" title=\"Religious Crimes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">idolatrous</a> worship of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eternal\" title=\"Eternal\">one or more Night eternals</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Madeiras\">Madeiras</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />A sprawling forest that extends northward to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren\" title=\"Miaren\">Miaren</a>.

It sees itself as the cultural centre of the League, and arguably the whole Empire. It takes its common epithet from the many mirrors found upon the roofs of the city, said to \"sparkle like gems\" during the day. Folk legend suggests that if the mirrors are shattered the city will surely fall, and for this reason some citizens carry a mirror about their person, an affectation that encourages unfair accusations of vanity.</p><p>Sarvos is as driven as any city in the League, but art is its true passion. They claim to have invented theatre, a ludicrous claim but believable in a city graced with so many theatre-houses. They are certainly the originators of the magician <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Troupes\" title=\"Troupes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">troupes</a> that are now commonplace throughout the League and they are usually the centre of League performance magic. Not just theatre is popular however; there are rival opera houses whose bitter divisions are every bit as keen as those of the leading theatre troupes. Several wealthy merchant princes have endowed their collections of art on the city and there are public galleries where the most beautiful pictures and sculptures can be viewed in exchange for a ring or two. </p><p>The land around the Bay of Catazar is lush and fertile, with low flood-plains; olive farms and prime grazing lands fed by the waters of four rivers: the lazy Couros that flows along the border of Highguard and Urizen; the flighty Scorrero, whose capricious nature has drowned many an unwary river captain on its course through the Brass Coast; the broad-banked Gancio, solid and well-defended; and the furious Vassa that flows down through Tassato.  The four rivers are central characters in the art and folklore of the city. All the classic literature and theatre includes them in one form or another, whether as central characters or \u201cclowns\u201d during the interludes. A popular game between playwrights and critics is to conceal the characters in some way and challenge the critic to locate them. </p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Sarvos was the birth-place of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Giselle\" title=\"Empress Giselle\">Empress Giselle</a>, who held the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Throne\" title=\"Throne\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Throne</a> between 331YE and 346YE. Sometimes called the <i>Unwise</i>, she was a shameless League patriot who put the needs of her nation above those of the Empire. Unlike the vast majority of Emperors and Empresses, after her death she was interred in a marble tomb in the Alvetti guild estates in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Caricomare\" title=\"Caricomare\">Caricomare</a>, where she remained until <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_sack_of_Sarvos\" title=\"The sack of Sarvos\">the sack of Sarvos</a> in 380YE. After the Grendel attempted to steal her body, and destroyed her tomb, there was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_other_empress\" title=\"The other empress\">discussion</a> about where best to reinter her.

Reclaiming the ruined quarter of the city was deemed \"too expensive\" by the Senate - a move that some bitter Sarvosans believed to have been intended as a punishment for the League and the city of Sarvos in particular, in the wake of the unpopular Empress's death. In 378YE, on the thirtieth anniversary of the destruction, work finally began to regenerate the ruined district thanks to generous donations and hard work by the citizens of Sarvos.</p><p>Also of note is the establishment of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos#Asavean_Embassy\">Asavean Embassy</a> in Sarvos. Senator Mirislav (who was also responsible for the restoration of Caricomare) arranged the establishment of a formal embassy with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Asavean_Archipelago\" title=\"Asavean Archipelago\">Asavean Archipelago</a> in 378YE.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</span></h3><p>The city of Sarvos covers the island of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos#Cigno\">Cigno</a> and in some places extends into the Bay on sturdy pontoons. It is widely said to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world - when the sun strikes the mirrored roofs at sunrise and sunset, the whole island glows like a star. Space is at a premium in Sarvos - cramped streets flow between soaring towers, choked with merchants, tradesmen and students. There are no \"green spaces\" in Sarvos - the island is simply to crowded and any parks that might once have existed have been built over in recent centuries. To combat this, the citizens often cultivate roof gardens and window-boxes, bringing beautiful and practical plants into their homes. The richest Sarvosan guilds maintain estates on the mainland, allowing the to \"get away from it all\" when the press of humanity becomes too much. The city is divided into several distinct districts, of which the more famous is probably the dockside ward of Caricomare.</p><p>Fire is a constant worry. While there has never been a significant blaze in Sarvos but many residents have regular nightmares that a major fire could destroy the entire city before it could be dealt with (although as one Tassatan wit said, \"<i>The whole place is so damp it would take a great deal of effort to set fire to even a small tower.</i>\")</p><p>It is the site of <b>Diora University</b>, a prominent seat of learning that specialises in researching obscure topics for money. Here can also be found <b>Capodomus Cathedral</b>, one of the largest religious structures in the Empire, a towering monument encrusted with precious materials and objets d\u2019art. It is most famous for its theatres, opera houses, galleries and conservatories - it is truly a city where art is held up as the highest aspiration of humanity. </p><p>Sarvos is also a byword for excellent food, and every bar, street vendor and hostelry prides itself on providing its own speciality snack: perhaps a particular way of spicing ham, or salting and smoking beef, or an excellent dipping sauce for vegetables. It is said that an epicure can dine out every night of their life in Sarvos and never eat the same meal twice - it is also home to a great many establishments that serve dishes native to distant nations, often in settings designed to cleverly evoke the sensation of actually being in one of those nations. </p><p>Sarvos is also a highly cosmopolitan city - it is common to hear a half-dozen tongues being spoken in the markets and bazaars.

Significant donations also came from Highguard - Dagon of the Shattered Tower, Asael of Cantiarch's Hold, the Virtues of Autumn Coven, and Hepzibah of Reumah's Redoubt all made considerable contributions. As a consequence, the main historical library has been renamed the <i>Shattered Tower Reliquary</i>, while major renovations to the faculty for theology and metaphysics have seen the wing that houses the main lecture halls for religious studies renamed <i>Permion's Thoughts</i>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Colossus_of_Sarvos\">The Colossus of Sarvos</span></h3><p>A wonder of the modern world the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lorenzo%27s_Legacy#The_Colossus_of_Sarvos\" title=\"Lorenzo's Legacy\">Colossus of Sarvos</a> is the first sight of the Jewelled City seen by ships approaching from the Bay of Catazar.

On the eastern side of the bridge is the town of <b>Trivento</b>. Once Trivento had ambitions to become a city to rival Sarvos, but this was before the bridge effectively removed their control of the Vassa crossing. Centuries later there is still some bitterness; Sarvosan sophisticates love to characterise inhabitants of Trivento as \"country cousins\", while the broadsheets of Trivento regularly depict Sarvos proper as a hive of vice and corruption that needs to be washed away. The people of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tassato\" title=\"Tassato\">Tassato</a> are known to gleefully poke both sides of this ancient enmity - and to be quietly pleased that there is not a second city on the Vassa. The establishment of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/College_of_the_Liberated\" title=\"College of the Liberated\">College of the Liberated</a> here in early 380YE went some way towards revitalising the economy of Trivento - as did <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_sack_of_Sarvos\" title=\"The sack of Sarvos\">the sack of Sarvos</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cigno\">Cigno</span></h3><p><b>Qualities: </b>City, Coastal<br />This is where the jewelled city of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos#Sarvos\">Sarvos</a> proper is found. It spreads across the entire island, and in some places extends a short distance into the bay on sturdy quays and pontoons. On the southern side of the island is the bustling mercantile district of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos#Caricomare\">Caricomare</a> - newly restored by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Foracci\">Foracci</span></h3><p>The wide plains and scattered woodlands of Foracci are the site of many \"country estates\" owned by guilds and wealthy individuals from Sarvos. Some bring additional profit to their owners, maintaining  <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> or <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">woodland preserves</a>. Examples include the hamlet of Aversa, known for strong red wines and cheeses and home to the well-to-do Corvinoscuri family (and also the location of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jade_Custodian\" title=\"Jade Custodian\">Wellspring of Jade</a>), or the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Signori_d%27Argento_Vine_Tender\" title=\"Signori d'Argento Vine Tender\">Signori d'Argento Vineyards</a> planted at the outskirts of Aversa Estate. While the region appears on the outside to be reasonably idyllic, there are enough nooks and crannies that travellers here are occasionally confronted with unscrupulous bandits, and most of the estates maintain a small cadre of guards in case these bandits become too ambitious. The wealth of Foracci is protected by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos#Our_Lady_of_Pride\">Our Lady of Pride</a>, a fortification built in Winter 381YE.</p><p>Upriver along the Gancio is <b>Rodez</b>, more of an extended suburb of Sarvos than a settlement in its own right. Its harbour is alive with many-oared craft of all sizes; river-boats stopping off from the north, freighters from foreign lands and pleasure-cruisers carrying the wealthy from Sarvos to their inland estates. Many overland visitors to Sarvos stop here to take a ferry to the island. On the outskirts of Rodez stands the famous Aldo di Saverio private hospital and the beautiful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Keeper_of_Emilio%27s_Herbarium#Emilio.27s_Herbarium\" title=\"Keeper of Emilio's Herbarium\">Emilio\u2019s Herbarium for Anvil Hospital</a>.</p><p>The banks of the Gancio in Foracci once served as the nesting grounds for the colonies of huge, white cranes that picked their way through the reed-beds of the river. Sometimes seen by the people of Sarvos as beautiful symbols of the city's Pride, other times as bloody nuisances, the population of Gancio cranes was nearly obliterated during the sack of Sarvos in 380YE. Grendel raiders and looters, pushing further upriver from the occupied city, ruthlessly hunted and butchered the cranes for their meat, feathers and eggs; in the aftermath, so few adult birds were left that their future was in grave doubt. However, following the use of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dramaturgy\" title=\"Dramaturgy\">dramaturgy</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League_hearth_magic\" title=\"The League hearth magic\">hearth magic</a> by League performers of the Four Rivers Theatre and Single Ring Strolling Players, the colonies have survived the worst of the disaster and begun the long, slow path to recovery. It will be years, even decades, before the 'white ships of the Gancio' are restored to their former numbers, but for many inhabitants of the city these proud cranes have come to represent the resilience and determination of Sarvos in the aftermath of the sack.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Riposi\">Riposi</span></h3><p>Riposi is a flat, open land with poor, chalky soil. The few farms here tend to own large herds of sheep and goats, and little else. Riposi was at one time known for the cleverness of its wolves and foxes, but in recent decades both species have been hunted to the point where they are rarely seen. The plains are always described as \"mournful\" or \"gloomy\" - cold winds regularly roar in off the Bay, and the influence of nearby <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis\" title=\"Necropolis\">Necropolis</a> helps contribute to the general atmosphere of sadness and desperation. A phrase that sees vogue in Sarvos from time to time refers to someone as being \"'<i>as poor as a Riposi dirt farmer</i>\" - which explains why few guilds admit to having holdings here. In the days before the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Orc_Rebellion\" title=\"The Orc Rebellion\">orc rebellion</a>, large numbers of slaves worked here and it was the site of a bloody confrontation between the revolting orcs and Imperial forces.

It takes its name from a tale that two shipwrecked children found a fortune in ancient pearls here, stashed by someone long-forgotten. Upon being rescued by local fisherfolk, they used the greater part of their wealth to finance a home for orphans in Sarvos in the name of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Little_Mother\" title=\"The Little Mother\">the Little Mother</a>.

Citizens of Temeschwar commonly make an effort to be as flamboyant as their southern fellows, but their dress is inevitably more practical, to accommodate the harsh northern weather. They are traditionally more brutally pragmatic than those who live on the bay. It is a foothold of trade to Varushka, Wintermark and nearby Dawn. Trading in raw materials and crafted goods, especially weapons and armour, it is seen by many as the merchant capital of the northern lands.</p><p>Despite its good relations with Varushka, Temeschwar has always suffered somewhat from being distant from Sarvos and Tassato whose close proximity made them the natural heart of the League. Temeschwar may well be the richest of all the cities of the League, but it can never quite shake the fear that it is not as good as the others.  This anxiety is just part of what drives the Temeschwari to be so competitive and so ruthless. Temeschwari strive to work that bit longer and that bit harder than anyone else in the League. If a Sarvossian closes their shop at sunset, their Temeschwari neighbour will light a pair of lanterns and keep trading for another hour.</p><p>Not all relations with Varushka are good, however. There is still some bad blood between those of old Varushkan stock in Temeschwar and the citizens of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karov#Delev\" title=\"Karov\">Delev</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karov\" title=\"Karov\">Karov</a>. When Temeschwar joined the Empire it attempted to prove that it had legitimate ownership of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karov#The_Eternal_Shafts_of_Time\" title=\"Karov\">Eternal Shafts of Time</a>, a rich mithril mine on the border between the two territories. There are still plays and theatrical adaptations that revolve around the underhand, ruthless way the boyar of Delev \"stole\" the mine from under the noses of the Temeschwari, and relations between some Delev traders and and some citizens of Temeschwar are chilly to this day - especially in the rare cases where there is some distant blood connection between the two.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Isabella de la Torre, of the Brotherhood of the Ashen Tower.\"><img alt=\"Isabella de la Torre, of the Brotherhood of the Ashen Tower.\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/d3/TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg/300px-TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/d3/TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg/450px-TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/d/d3/TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">They wear their reputation for cold, hard dealing with pride.</div></div><p>The Temeschwari are not just the most competitive people in the League, they also have a well deserved reputation as the most ruthless. In the years before the creation of the Empire, the city was plagued by gangs of thieves and assassins who operated with open impunity despite the best efforts of the boyar, Ratibor. Thousands of inhabitants were linked with the different gangs who used tattoos to mark membership and enforce loyalty.</p><p>In the end Ratibor hired a force of Varushkan mercenaries and brought them in secret into the city during the depths of winter. In the notorious night of a thousand torches (named for the torches the soldiers carried to light their way) every inhabitant of the city was turned out of their beds, stripped and searched for marks. Anyone with a tattoo on their body was given a few minutes to collect their belongings before being forced from the city into the frozen snows beyond the walls. A few managed to bribe their way past the search but most were given over to the winter and were never seen again. The act was one of monstrous brutality, but it established the power of Ratibor as boyar and broke the power of the criminal gangs forever.</p><p>The Temeschwari wear their reputation for cold, hard dealing with pride. They view themselves as the strongest people in the League, combining the ambition and drive of the south with the strength and determination of the north. Physical as well as mental strength is prized here - Temeschwari bravos are as likely to favour the axe as the rapier - and her free companies have a reputation for toughness, as soldiers and as people. Most Temeschwari free companies are careful not to break the rules for they know the magistrates watch them carefully - but they will do almost anything required to win short of this. You can find many things in Temeschwar, it is said, but you will not find a scruple though you search the city from sunrise to sunset.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Rumours suggest that the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vyig\" title=\"Vyig\">vyig</a> criminal organisation has become active again in the northern city. This Varushkan criminal fraternity is untied by an absolute hatred of Imperial law, and once threatened to overtake both Temeschwar and the League.

Structures are built to last in Temeschwar, with stone being a much more popular building material than wood, and with slate roofs more common than thatch. The city is extremely cold during the Winter (and during late Autumn and early Spring most years), and snowfall is a regular problem not faced by the inhabitants of more southerly cities of the League.</p><p>The people have a well deserved reputation for competitiveness, and for ruthlessness. Temeschwar may well be the richest of all the cities of the League, but it can never quite shake the fear that it is not as good as the others. This anxiety is just part of what drives the Temeschwari to be so competitive and so ruthless. Temeschwari strive to work that bit longer and that bit harder than anyone else in the League.

While not on the scale of the walls of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg\" title=\"Holberg\">Holberg</a> in the east, they have proved more than sufficient to protect the city from its enemies. Nine great towers are placed roughly equidistant around the walls, seven named for each of the Virtues and two (those that incorporate the gates through which the Gancio enters and leaves the city) called the Northern and Southern Rivergates. Each is equipped with a great iron bell, used to toll the hours, and to warn of potential dangers. In cases of fire, for example, the bell in the tower nearest the blaze is sounded repeatedly until the flames are extinguished.</p><p>Temeschwar has grown since the walls were built, of course, and there are nearly as many buildings outside the walls as there are within them. In times of emergency, however, the population can take refuge within the walls - although how long Temeschwar could survive an actual siege remains to be seen</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Bloody_Great_Theatre\">The Bloody Great Theatre</span></h3><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lorenzo%27s_Legacy#Boody_Great_Threatre\" title=\"Lorenzo's Legacy\">Bloody Great Theatre</a> is one of the most prominent theatres in the Empre.

This ancient hillfort consists of a ruined set of concentric rings of black stone, believed to have been of Terunael origin (although some scholars claim the Terun simply adapted a much older structure, perhaps one built by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Sentinel\" title=\"The Sentinel\">The Sentinel</a>). The fort was in ruins when the first <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushkan</a> settlers came here, believed to be a casualty of the wars between the people of Terunael and the orcs. Human settlers lost no time in incorporating the sturdy stones of the ruin into their own fortification. </p><p>Throughout its history, people who have spent long periods of time here have reported strange dreams - dreams of sadness, loss and bittersweet remembrance. Unlike many such 'accurs\u00e8d places' it gained a reputation for strangeness, rather than terror or fear, and in the early years of the Empire became something of a place of pilgrimage for those suffering grief or regret. </p><p>The fortification here was decomissioned during the reign of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Mariika\" title=\"Empress Mariika\">Empress Mariika</a>, during a compromise which saw funds channeled to the fortification of Temeschwar itself. Mellfort has not seen use as a fortress for many years, but following the fall of Skarsind there was discussion of rebuilding it as a watchpost and beacon. In early 377YE the fortress was partially refitted to serve as a base of operation for groups of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bravo\" title=\"Bravo\">bravos</a> hunting bandits and brigands preying on Temeschwari trade. Overseen by Bridget Eastville (senator for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mitwold\" title=\"Mitwold\">Mitwold</a>) as part of a larger plan to provide protection to towns throughout the Empire, the defences are not sufficient to qualify Mellfort as a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortifications\" title=\"Fortifications\" class=\"mw-redirect\">fortification</a>, but they have already helped reduce outlawry throughout the territory. They have also lead to further discussion about completing the work and restoring Mellfort to its former glory as a strategically placed fortification.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lorenzo.27s_Deep_Pockets\">Lorenzo's Deep Pockets</span></h3><p>Just over a month after the Spring Equinox 381YE a large section of north-western <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren#Goldglades\" title=\"Miaren\">Goldglades</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren\" title=\"Miaren\">Miaren</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rocks_and_gravel\" title=\"Rocks and gravel\">collapsed with an almighty roar</a>.

Estimated to be seven hundred feet deep, with a lake at the bottom that may well be bottomless. The cliff walls are nearly vertical, and still prone to collapse in some places, but there are also signs of caves and tunnels opening out in several places.

The full extent of the network of caverns here has yet to be determined. More worryingly, some of the early daredevils who have made a preliminary investigation of some of the more accessibly caves and tunnels have failed to return - and all those who have made it back in one piece have described encounters with particularly angry <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trogoni\" title=\"Trogoni\">trogoni</a> - creatures rarely encountered outside of the mountains of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a>, and the northern peaks of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Wintermark</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushka</a>.</p><p>The sinkhole was officially named \"<a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Delver_of_the_Depths#Lorenzo.27s_Deep_Pockets\" title=\"Delver of the Depths\">Lorzeno's Deep Pockets</a>\" by Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar, but is sometimes known smirkingly as \"The Foxhole\" or (rather more lewdly) as \"La Volpe's Arse\".</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-left\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Butchers.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Lorenzo \u201cLa Volpe\u201d Macelliao and Janusz Dalibor of the Butchers Bank.\"><img alt=\"Lorenzo \u201cLa Volpe\u201d Macelliao and Janusz Dalibor of the Butchers Bank.\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/4/42/Butchers.jpg/300px-Butchers.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/4/42/Butchers.jpg/450px-Butchers.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/4/42/Butchers.jpg/600px-Butchers.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">The politics of Temeschwar can be robust even for the League.</div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hanuri\">Hanuri</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> City, Fortification<br />The main feature of Hanuri is the city of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Temeschwar#Temeschwar\">Temeschwar</a> itself.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Locul\">Locul</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />Much of the territory of Temeschwar is rugged and hilly, but in Locul the foothills rise steeply into the heights of <b>Mellfort Peak</b> which takes its name from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Temeschwar#Mellfort\">hill fort</a> built on the upper slopes.

Proud of its independence, Holberg eventually joined <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a> in 136YE under a riot of political strife in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Senate</a>. The lands that surrounded the city were under the control of barbarian orcs until they were driven back in an epic five year war of conquest by Dawnish nobles and forces loyal to them. But Holberg itself was never conquered; the city was protected by a dozen high walls and the Dawnish armies had little taste for a lengthy siege. When the city was convinced to side with the Empire by League diplomats, it also successfully requested the Senate assign the territory to the League. Dawnish senators were incandescent with fury but there was nothing they could do and Holberg became the prosperous fourth city of the League.</p><p>In the decades that followed Holberg grew rich and prosperous. The lands around the city possessed a rich agricultural heritage, well known for their fine vineyards. </p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>In 346YE, however, barbarians attacked the territory, sacked the vineyards, burnt the hardwood groves so precious to the city's crossbow makers, and laid siege to the walled city. The Senate remained paralysed throughout this time, unable to secure funding and forces to raise the siege and in the end the territory was lost to the orcs and remained under Orc rule for over thirty years.</p><p>By early 377YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortifications\" title=\"Fortifications\" class=\"mw-redirect\">walls of Holberg</a> were in a sorry state.

Money and resources supplied to the city allowed for emergency repairs to be made to the walls, while herbs and medical supplies helped to counter the insidious effects of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> poisons. Despite the fact that the city was under siege, heroic action meant that the defences were restored to full strength.</p><p>In Summer 378YE, the defenders had been <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/378YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#The_Siege_of_Holmauer\" title=\"378YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">forced back to defensive positions</a> within the upper city.

The Druj fortress of Rebeshof was devastated, and the barbarian invaders driven back to the northern forests.

They have since settled in, building several villages along the shore, and begun to explore the marshes of Ennerlund, Rebeshof, and the Morass.

Famous for its engineers, builders and architects, the city is immensely fortified and defenders held out against barbarian attack for over thirty years. The only approach to the city that remains viable is through a narrow pass that leads over the mountains and into Dawn.  Now Holberg is back in Imperial hands the people look forward to their newly appointed Senator rebuilding the city to its former glory. </p><p>Holberg has always been a vital part of the League. The city is notorious for its inventive brilliance, its ability to think of ingenious solutions to problems. Holberg invented the crossbow, but it is not inventions it is known for, so much as the ability of the inhabitants to use what they have to find solutions never before seen. Many Holberghians see life as a complex puzzle, one for which they are seeking the solution. They do not respect flights of fancy - but these people have found ways to build a city on a mountainside. They are utterly pragmatic but ingenious with it.</p><p>There is also an emphasis on learning and study that is found nowhere else in the Empire outside Urizen. Holberg already had its own university when it joined the League, something the other cities soon copied. It does not have great libraries to rival <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen\" title=\"Urizen\">Urizen</a> or <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard\" title=\"Highguard\">Highguard</a> - although it has more than its fair share of specialists such as the bookbinders of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg_spoils_of_war#Ledger_Domain\" title=\"Holberg spoils of war\">Leger Domain</a> - but it is a centre of excellence for tutelage, particularly in practical skills like engineering and surgery. There have been several free companies from Holberg whose reputation as siege engineers was unrivalled throughout the Empire. Holberg gives the League a scholarly excellence that allows it to hold its own with rival nations like Urizen - they may not have been able to retake the lowlands without help from the Empire, but they ensured that the city did not fall to the Druj.</p><p>One of the finest engineering guilds in Holberg is <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg_spoils_of_war#Wunderking\" title=\"Holberg spoils of war\"><i>Wunderkind</i></a>. With a legacy that reaches back to the time before Holberg was part of the Empire, the engineers of Wunderkind were known for centuries for the creation and design of everything from toys to fountains to siege engines and crossbows - and everything in between. The Grand Clocktower - a unique wonder in the Empire, a mechanical time-keeping device on a massive scale, was built by the founders of the guild.</p><p>Holberg is also known for its doctors - many of whom gave their lives fighting on the front lines. The warrior-healer of Holberg is already becoming a popular mythopoetic figure and characters such as the late physick and apothecary <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg_spoils_of_war#Doctor_Ventner.27s_Greenhouse\" title=\"Holberg spoils of war\">Doctor Ventner</a> are appearing in plays and pamphlets as far south as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos\" title=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Great_Pits_of_Ennerlund\">The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_Pits_of_Ennerlund\" title=\"Great Pits of Ennerlund\">Great Pits of Ennerlund</a></span></h3><p>The Great Pits of Ennerlund are a Bourse resource located (unsurprisingly) in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg#Ennerlund\">Ennerlund</a>.

Over time the shattered wasteland was cleared and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Territory#region\" title=\"Territory\">region</a> laid out as broad parkland. </p><p>In contrast to the cramped, bustling, brick-and-stone aesthetic of the city proper, Holmauer is now a gentle, restful area of open parks and well-maintained orchards dotted with buildings of white granite and fine marble. The extensive landscaping of the park has led to pleasant paths snaking through flower gardens, grassy banks and natural forest areas. There are row boats for hire on the lakes and river and a new folly on the island for visitors to enjoy. The park includes a beautiful open-air venue for concerts and plays, a public bath house built by the finest <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard\" title=\"Highguard\">Highborn</a> artisans, and the wonderful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Keeper_of_the_Imperial_Menagerie#Imperial_Menagerie\" title=\"Keeper of the Imperial Menagerie\">Imperial Menagerie</a>.

Makeshift barricades gave way to increasingly sophisticated fortresses, and then to rubble. The walls of Holmauer finally ceased to be a consideration in the Autumn of 378YE - a shattered casualty of the ebb and flow of battle against the Druj.</p><p>After the liberation,a few refugees sought to regain their homes in Holmauer, but in most cases literally nothing remained.

Rebuilding the suburbs of Holberg represented an immense undertaking, especially in the absence of the walls that once protected them.

Painstakingly crafted from the finest materials, inlaid with dragonbone, orichalcum, and tempest jade, it is a true wonder that combines modern artistic techniques with traditional sensibilities.

She rests one hand on the mane of a mighty lion, its head bowed but its strength undiminished by its expression of respect.</p><p>There are many other subtle touches however, relating to the past and future not only of Holberg, but of the League and the Empire itself. In one part, depicting the armies of the League taking back Holberg, is a image of the late General Giovanni Saverio di Sarvos. By contrast, around the borders of the frieze are images of the present and the future - the four Senators of the League in the corners, and the Cardinals of Prosperity, Ambition, and Vigilance; the Imperial Inquisitor; the Ambassadors to Asavea and Faraden; the Imperial Consul; and the Grandmaster of the Golden Pyramid along the top and bottom edges.</p>The frieze was created by an affiliation of Holberg artists and citizens, partially commissioned by Aureliana Saverio di Sarvos and Othello von Holberg, and created with permission from Benedict Parelli of the Empress's household and the consent of the Senator of Holberg.</div></div><!-- NewPP limit reportCached time: 20220329001441Cache expiry: 86400Dynamic content: falseCPU time usage: 0.105 secondsReal time usage: 0.108 secondsPreprocessor visited node count: 7699/1000000Preprocessor generated node count: 12086/1000000Post\u2010expand include size: 2178/2097152 bytesTemplate argument size: 351/2097152 bytesHighest expansion depth: 3/40Expensive parser function count: 0/100--><!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)100.00%   81.431      1 - -total 93.72%   76.320      1 - Template:Senate_Elections  2.83%    2.303      1 - Template:Anchor  2.26%    1.837      3 - Template:CaptionedImage--></div><div class=\"printfooter\">Retrieved from \"<a target=\"_blank\"dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.ukhttps://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/index.php?title=Holberg&amp;oldid=83223\">https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/index.php?title=Holberg&amp;oldid=83223</a>\"</div>        <hr/><small></small>      </div>        </div><!--/span-->      </div><!--/row-->        </div><!--/.fluid-container-->        <div id=\"footer\" class=\"container-fluid\">        <div class=\"row-fluid\"><div class=\"span4\">"

The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Grendel\" title=\"Grendel\">Grendel</a> have attacked the islands and towns here for centuries; usually their fleets are intercepted at sea before they can do too much damage, but there have been times when their raiders have sacked coastal settlements. For a few harrowing months in the years before the foundation of the Empire, the Grendel swept inland here conquering <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#Lightsea\">Lightsea</a> and the islands, and threatening to burn Siroc. They were turned back after months of vicious fighting, but the memory of their attack is sometimes credited by historians as being a factor in the decision of the Freeborn to join the Empire.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>After the Autumn Equinox 381YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Grendel\" title=\"Grendel\">Grendel</a> armada invaded Madruga.

It lies in Madruga close by the border with Feroz. Brightly coloured tents extend Siroc out far beyond the small cluster of stone buildings that make up the heart of the city. Sails of all shapes and sizes fill the sheltered bay, which is guarded by a series of iron woven nets and chains bought at great expense from the forges of Wintermark. The city is said to have been founded by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Guerra\" title=\"Guerra\">Guerra</a> family shortly after the Freeborn came to the Brass Coast.</p><p>Siroc is the site of the <b>Glass Parador</b>.

It consists of several buildings built after the severe Commonwealth style, which stand in beautifully laid out and maintained gardens, surrounded by a low white granite wall. Despite the severity of the architecture, the embassy is surprisingly welcoming - the gates stand permanently open, albeit under the watchful gaze of a cadre of Commonwealth soldiers attached to the ambassador. The majority of the staff are human, although there are apparently half-a-dozen orcs whose role on the ambassadorial staff is not clear. There are no daeva citizens working at the embassy as far as Imperial observers can make out.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Atalaya\">Atalaya</span></h3><p>The town of Atalaya in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#Free_Landing\">Free Landing</a> marks the place where the Brass Coast was born; the first landing of the three sisters and their families. Built around the side of a secluded cove, the seas around the island that share its name are a navigational nightmare. Before the Shining Pillar was built, reaching the hidden docks of Atalaya was a feat to tax the most skilled ship's crews. Today, the landwards channel has been widened but is protected by hidden obstructions that only the Freeborn pilots know well. Atalaya is also known for its deep natural harbour - many ships of the Freeborn fleet count Atalaya as their home port.</p><p>Atalaya is the oldest Freeborn settlement in the Brass Coast, but its prominence was eclipsed centuries ago by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#Lightsea\">Quzar</a>.

A shorter road runs along the northern banks of the Scorrero, crossing just north of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura#Cerevado\" title=\"Segura\">Cerevado</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura\" title=\"Segura\">Segura</a> via a beautiful arched bridge of white granite. While the road is used extensively by the Farden, it also serves to cut the journey time from the northern borders of Madruga to the trading city of Siroc, making it a popular route for Freeborn and League merchants as well.</p><p>The south-west roads are a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_work\" title=\"Great work\">great work</a> that complement the already existing <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lorenzo%27s_Legacy#Blood_Red_Roads\" title=\"Lorenzo's Legacy\">Blood Red Roads</a>, bringing increased prosperity to the owners of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Business\" title=\"Business\">businesses</a> in Madruga.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Salt_Guard\">The Salt Guard</span></h3><p>A grand <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_same_bed#The_Salt_Guard\" title=\"The same bed\">designed</a> by Menno van Ritsjhof comprised of two stout fortifications on either side of the bay along the approach to Siroc. Each fort is equipped with powerful trebuchet and catapults. A garrison of skilled mariners and corsairs ensures the towers are always ready to respond to any threat, and with the significant reinforcement of the existing iron chains and nets that guard the harbour they are extremely effective against shore offensives. He believes that not only will a sea assault against Siroc be made nigh impossible, but that the garrisons of the two towers would also be in a position to protect the Lyceum which lies to the south-east of Siroc proper.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Calvos_Sound\">Calvos Sound</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Coastal<br />The town of <b>Calvos</b> stands on the shores of Calvos Sound.

Here the climate is warm and humid, perfect for the cultivation of different plants. This is the home of the fabulous spice gardens of Feroz, a source of great revenue for the people of this territory. The seas are more treacherous here, and until recently the south and the west were constantly threatened by barbarians by land. As a result, many armed merchants patrol the seas, and groups of young warriors journeyed along the borders, fighting skirmishes against jealous foes.</p><p>There is a traditional rivalry between the families of Feroz and those of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga\" title=\"Madruga\">Madruga</a> to the north. Madruga was the first settled territory of the Freeborn, and there is a popular stereotype that the people who live there are \"stuck up\". This stereotype is more humorous than hateful - the Freeborn move around too much to allow such prejudice to root itself too firmly in their psyche.

Across the bay from billowing <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#Siroc\" title=\"Madruga\">Siroc</a> this thriving port specialised in high-value products such as fine wines and spice mixes. Unsurprisingly, given its position, for most of its history it has engaged in low-key economic warfare with its larger cousin to the north - Oran notably has cheaper dock fees than Siroc, and a number of entrepreneurs prefer to operate here as a consequence. it is especially welcoming to those merchants who are just starting out, and has a reputation for being more energetic than its competitors to the north and south. This energy has been significantly boosted by construction of the only open <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feroz#The_Temple_of_Balo_and_the_Black_Bull\">Asavean Temple</a> in the entire Empire; the surge of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Asavean_Archipelago\" title=\"Asavean Archipelago\">Asavean</a> ships visiting Oran saw the town expand significantly to become the largest trading port in Feroz.</p><p>In Spring 383YE, however, Oran was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/383YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Spindrift\" title=\"383YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">conquered by the Grendel</a>.

Among other things, this invasion saw the collapse of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Broken_Shore_Bounty\" title=\"Broken Shore Bounty\">Broken Shore Bounty</a>, the Scorrero Nets falling into orc hands, and the Temple of Balo and the Black Bull sealing its doors against the orcs while offering sanctuary to Freeborn families. </p><p>Following the treaty signed during the Autumn Equinox, the Grendel have opened Oran as a port <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Everything_has_a_price#A_New_Destination\" title=\"Everything has a price\">available to Imperial captains</a>. It remains to be seen how long this situation can continue.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Temple_of_Balo_and_the_Black_Bull\">The Temple of Balo and the Black Bull</span></h3><p>During the Spring Equinox 380YE, permission was granted to the people of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Asavean_Archipelago\" title=\"Asavean Archipelago\">Asavean Archipelago</a> to construct a major temple to their gods in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feroz#Oranseri\">Oran</a>. Initially, construction was expected to be completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox 380YE, but the temple did not actually open its doors until shortly before the Spring Solstice 381YE. The town is seeing an influx of Asavean shipping bringing white granite and architects to the Brass Coast, as well as throwing crowns around like water to secure local labour to complete their project. Relations between the people of the Empire and the priests of Asavea are monitored by <i><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/El_oficial_de_enlace_imperial_con_los_sacerdotes_de_Balo_y_el_toro_negro\" title=\"El oficial de enlace imperial con los sacerdotes de Balo y el toro negro\" class=\"mw-redirect\">El oficial de enlace imperial con los sacerdotes de Balo y el toro negro</a></i> (\"The Imperial intermediary to the priests of Balo and the Black Bull\"), who among other things is able to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ministry\" title=\"Ministry\">buy Asavean goods</a> at a reduced price. During the Summer Solstice 380YE, the Assembly of Nine supported Agnetha de Rondell in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Temple_of_the_bull#Resolution\" title=\"Temple of the bull\">denouncing</a> the temple as an idolatrous affront, making it significantly harder for the Asaveans to find laborers prepared to work on the construction and both delaying its completion and laying a significant economic burden on the foreign priests.</p><p>The temple remained extremely controversial among Imperial priests. When Oran fell, however, the priests at the temple <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/383YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Sand\" title=\"383YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">offered sanctuary</a> to a number of Freeborn families in spite of Grendel unhappiness. In the following months, several of those families were smuggled to safety in Madruga, although an unknown number remain as guests at the temple. Despite this, however, it is clear that the Asaveans are more than happy to work with the new owners of Oran - indeed there are rumours that they have already recognised a Grendel as the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Delegate_to_the_Temple_in_Feroz\" title=\"Imperial Delegate to the Temple in Feroz\">Delegate to the Temple in Feroz</a>.

Smaller than the town of Cazar, Shantarim has a reputation for being somewhat less cosmopolitan than the other towns of Feroz - visitors from mainland families sometimes encounter prejudice and suspicion. The families of Shantarim more than make up for their relatively small size with the enthusiasm with which they opposed the orcs of the Broken Shore. Prior to the peace treaty, they were loud supporters of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Freeborn_Storm\" title=\"Freeborn Storm\">Freeborn Storm</a>, and the various raids against the Grendel. The signing of the peace treaty with the southern orcs has tied their hands - its no longer legal for them to fight the Grendel - which has been a major source of dissension in Shantarim.</p><div style=\"float:right; width: 450px; clear: right;\"><div class=\"box\"><div class=\"box-inner\"><b>Justicars</b><br />The priests who previously lived on the Isle of the Osseini called themselves <i>justicars</i>.

Never particularly populous, their sanctuary on the Isle of the Osseini was all but wiped out by the Grendel. A handful remained elsewhere, and during the Autumn Equinox 383YE the Freeborn assembly <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/383YE_Autumn_Equinox_Synod_judgements#Judgement_22\" title=\"383YE Autumn Equinox Synod judgements\">called on them to come together to preserve their traditions</a>.

Foreigners claimed the Isle was haunted by those who had died at sea at the hands of the corsairs of Shantarim, but most Freeborn had no truck with such foolishness. In 383YE, however, it became clear these tales of ghosts were more than just idle gossip. During the Spring Equinox of that year, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Grendel\" title=\"Grendel\">Grendel</a> shaman attempted to unleash a ghostly legion of drowned orcs bound in some fashion to white granite pillars on the island against the defenders of Feroz. Before they could do so they were <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/383YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#The_World_is_Not_Enough\" title=\"383YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">thwarted by Imperial heroes</a> who reached the isle via the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sentinel_Gate\" title=\"Sentinel Gate\">Sentinel Gate</a>. Once the heroes retreated, the status of the island, the pillars, and the remaining priests was unknown.</p><p>Then in Autumn 383YE, as part of the negotiations that lead to the peace treaty with the Grendel, a contract was negotiated with the orc diplomat regarding the Isle of the Osseini. In the wake of that agreement, a small group of priests were allowed to visit the Isle with a Grendel escort. There they discovered the remaining priests were dead, the ghost-binding pillars had been destroyed, and the island was in the hands of a coven of Grendel magicians. The orcs had already constructed a permanent residence there built around a particular Winter regio, and were less than welcoming to the Freeborn. Further negotiations followed; in the end the Freeborn were allowed to establish a small enclave here, under the careful watch of the Grendel.</p><p><b>OOC Note:</b> You can learn more about the Isle of the Osseini in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bones_in_the_ocean\" title=\"Bones in the ocean\">Bones in the ocean</a> wind of fortune. </p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Spice_Gardens_of_Feroz\">The Spice Gardens of Feroz</span></h3><p>In western <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feroz#Morajasse\">Morajasse</a> stand the legendary Spice Gardens of Feroz - a set of heavily-walled enclosures covering several acres where the finest spices in the Empire are grown.

If there is any solace to be taken from this development, it is that the Grendel appreciate fine spices as much as any Freeborn so it is unlikely that they will want to harm these legendary Gardens. On the other hand, some Freeborn find the idea of their beautiful spice gardens being operated by Grendel slaves particularly heinous.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Scorrero_Nets\">The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Scorrero_Nets\" title=\"Scorrero Nets\">Scorrero Nets</a></span></h3><p>The Scorrero Nets are a Bourse resource located in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feroz#Oranseri\">Oranseri</a>, seized by the Grendel in Spring 383YE as part of their conquest of Feroz.

It is not hard to reach, but it stands alone in a sea of sprawling grasslands and does not encourage casual visitors. On nights when powerful magics are performed, Afar is visible for miles around - great bonfires are built and massive drums used to build powerful rhythms to help raise (or draw down, or both) the passionate energy for powerful workings.</p><p>As with the rest of Feroz, Afarjasse is now in the hands of the Grendel. The governor, Lord Rahab, has by all accounts made it clear that the hakima here will not be permitted access to their potent regio - it is after all an important strategic resource.

The corsairs of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Feroz#Shantarim\">Shantarim</a> for example are renowned both for their enthusiastic rivalry with all other corsair families, and the zeal with which they waged war on the Grendel.

Before the Grendel invasion it served as an important hub for the Imperial wine trade, with many excellent vintages passing through its docks - both from the Brass Coast to the rest of the world, and from the rest of the world to the Brass Coast (and thus the Empire).

In recent years, the port has grown in prominence and prosperity; it now serves as the seat of power for the Grendel governor Lord Rahab.

The river Scorrero is wide and deep between Feroz and Madruga. During the Summer Solstice 383YE, the Grendel invaders attempted to take advantage of this by taking control of both bridges that connect the two Freeborn territories. Had they been successful, it would have been significantly harder for Imperial forces to move between Siroc and Oranseri. While their attempts were stymied, that potentially exploitable weakness remains.</p><p><b>Joharra</b> is a port south of Oran, considered much more stable than its northern cousin, and better known for its industry than its trade. Famous throughout the Empire for its cloth and dye-work, Joharra is called <i> the Rainbow</i> by coastal sailors who mark their progress round the coast with the first sight of the great billowing cloths hung out to dry on tall wooden frames along the low cliffs. As with the other settlements of Oran, the weavers and dyers here now labour under the yoke of the Grendel orcs.</p><div style=\"float: right; width=300px; margin-right:10px; margin-left: 10px; clear: right;\"><table><tr><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Summit</th><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Elected</th></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 383YE</td><td>Chiara Zayden Riqueza</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 382YE</td><td>Chiara Zayden Riqueza</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 381YE</td><td>Chiara Zayden Riqueza</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 380YE</td><td>Oria</td></tr><tr><td>Spring Equinox 380YE</td><td>Pedro i Taziel i Riqueza</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 379YE</td><td>Liythos i Purjo i Guerra</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 378YE</td><td>Kattalin Hazana</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 377YE</td><td>Sallur i Mnajdra i Guerra</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Solstice 376YE</td><td>Sallur i Mnajdra i Guerra</td></tr></table></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_Senate_Elections\">Recent Senate Elections</span></h2><p>As an Imperial territory, Feroz was represented by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> elected in the Summer.

                "description": "<p>The mountains of Kahraman rise from the great grasslands of Soroche  to the south and the Mournwold to the north, presenting a treacherous land of broken rock and barren mountainside. Fast-flowing streams spill down deep jagged-edged valleys. There is precious little in the way of vegetation, only scrub that clings to the slopes. However, there are riches in the mountains: here, the Freeborn find precious metals and minerals, often as sediment lying in the streambeds. Scattered settlements shelter in the valleys, with the remains of stone fortresses and watchtowers decaying on the heights above, remnants from the days before the Empire when the Freeborn warred with the Marches.</p><p>To the south of the mountains of Kahraman lie sweeping grass plains, a seemingly desolate landscape dotted with strange rock formations shaped by the wind. Here the Freeborn graze the bulk of their herds of goats and sheep. The wind from the west, the Del\u00e9s, is constant and bitingly cold at night. As a result, for shelter, Freeborn communities settle in bowl-shaped depressions cut from the earth, their tents sunk below the plains' surface.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Family\" title=\"Family\">families</a> of Kahraman have a somewhat undeserved reputation for being quarrelsome; as a response, the Freeborn established the post of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dhomiro_of_the_Cinnabar_Hills\" title=\"Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills\">Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills</a> to help mediate their disputes and to encourage trade between the sometimes quite isolated settlements here.

Descended from mine working slaves who revolted during the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Orc_Rebellion\" title=\"The Orc Rebellion\">orc rebellion</a>, they refused all overtures from the Empire and expressed no interest in becoming <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs\" title=\"Imperial Orcs\">Imperial orcs</a>. Rather they created out-of-the-way strongholds for themselves and proceeded to prey on travellers and poorly defended caravans. Most of their spite was reserved for traders trying to cross the mountains to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liathaven\" title=\"Liathaven\">Liathaven</a>, but in the years since they went rogue they have launched more than one concerted attack on a mining camp or northern village. The Empire would very much like to deal with them permanently, but they are like weeds - when one group is put down, another springs up a few years later to claim its territory.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fort_Braydon\">Fort Braydon</span></h3><p>Fort Braydon is very old, built in the early decades of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast\" title=\"The Brass Coast\">the Brass Coast</a> to protect the miners of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman#Braydon.27s_Jasse\">Braydon's Jasse</a> from the barbarian orcs who once dominated Kahraman.

Several times in the centuries since there were calls for the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> to be decommissioned - calls the Freeborn defeated each time they were raised. While the castle itself protected a \"safe\" border, the garrison has long served to police the northern hills of the territory against bandits and the incursions of the western orcs. When the Mournwold <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mournwold#Recent_History\" title=\"Mournwold\">fell</a>, the fort helped to drive back more than one attempt to extend Jotun dominion south, and supported efforts to keep the Lasambrians out of the rich hills. The continuing war with the Jotun has secured Fort Braydon's important role in protecting the cinnabar hills from western aggression.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Great_Mine_of_Briante\">The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_Mine_of_Briante\" title=\"Great Mine of Briante\">Great Mine of Briante</a></span></h3><p>The Great Mine of Briante is a Bourse resource located in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman#Serra_Briante\">Briante</a>.

                "description": "<p>Like southern <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman\" title=\"Kahraman\">Kahraman</a>, it is a land of rolling grass plains where great herds once grazed. Scattered with villages and lonely ranches, it was famous for its windswept grandeur and occasionally stark beauty. Its wealth came in part from the farms and herds, and in part from the cunning of its merchants. Segura was once a centre of trade for the Freeborn with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Faraden\" title=\"Faraden\">Faraden</a> to the west and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Iron_Confederacy\" title=\"Iron Confederacy\">Iron Confederacy</a> to the south. In Anduz, the Freeborn rubbed shoulders with the traders of these nations and acted as a trade gateway for the Empire.</p><p>The grasslands were no stranger to violence; on at least two occasions, armies from the Iron Confederacy pushed across Imperial borders and attempted to stage an invasion. In pre-Imperial times, there were occasional tragic border skirmishes with the Faraden. For the most part, however, the buffer provided by the Lasambrian Hills to the south and west meant that foreign armies rarely had the stomach for protracted campaigns. For most of the last two centuries, Segura was a centre of trade rather than conflict. The Freeborn prospered in the certain knowledge that their way of life was secure ... until the barbarians of the Lasambrian Hills put aside their differences and sent a great army sweeping down to burn and pillage the plains of Segura.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>The peace of Segura came to an abrupt end in 363YE when a great force of barbarians moved in from the west and took Anduz, scattering the foreigners and the Freeborn and burning much of the grassland. In quick succession, they swept through Yellow Chase and Anozeseri. The Freeborn <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura#The_Brass_Coast_military_concerns\">armies</a> clashed with the barbarian forces on the Iron Plains, but after days of vicious fighting, they were slowly pushed back to Anozel. The Freeborn senators demanded assistance in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Senate</a> but while they had the support of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Hugh\" title=\"Emperor Hugh\">Emperor Hugh</a> for a campaign to drive the barbarians back, the rest of the Senate and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Military_Council\" title=\"Imperial Military Council\">Military Council</a> seemed more interested in apportioning blame than helping the Freeborn. The political position was exacerbated by the deaths of the General of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_military_concerns#The_Red_Wind_Corsairs\" title=\"The Brass Coast military concerns\">Red Wind Corsairs</a> and the Senators for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga\" title=\"Madruga\">Madruga</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kahraman\" title=\"Kahraman\">Kahraman</a> during the fighting on the Iron Plains. When Burnish fell to the barbarians in 367YE, nobody outside the Brass Coast seemed to notice or care.</p><p>Segura remained a battleground for over a decade; every time the Freeborn tried to reclaim ground they were fought back. The garrison at Anozel kept regular patrols across the remaining regions, and the Lasambrian armies themselves seemed disinterested in doing more than occasionally raiding into the remaining Freeborn territories. Reports from the interior claimed that, after a frenzy of initial looting and killing, the orcs made only minimal efforts to slaughter those Freeborn who had not fled to the safety of Sobral Grasses or Lucksprings.</p><p>Many of the Seguran refugees settled near Anozel, Sobral or Cerevado. Those who left Segura for the comparative safety of the other Freeborn territories tended to maintain a distinctly nomadic lifestyle; they refused to settle down because to do so would be to admit that they would never return to Segura. Many now operate travelling <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_economic_interests\" title=\"The Brass Coast economic interests\">parador</a>; among the most famous is that of <i>Shula i Ezmara i Erigo</i> the 'mother of orphans' whose family includes large numbers of adopted Seguran orphans. Refugees from the rolling plains sing the lament <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lost_Segura\" title=\"Lost Segura\">Lost Segura</a> to remember its loss, and often display a weary camaraderie between families and tribes - a result of their shared experiences.</p><p>In the Winter of 377YE a major offensive by the Red Wind Corsairs and Hounds of Glory, supported by a powerful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bound_by_Common_Cause\" title=\"Bound by Common Cause\">enchantment</a> and over a thousand <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Military_unit\" title=\"Military unit\">auxiliaries</a> drove the Lasambrians out of the Sorbal Grasses, liberated the farms of Anozeseri and forced a barbarian retreat across the Iron Plains.</p><p>At the Autumn Equinox 378YE summit at Anvil, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> accepted an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Declare_peace_with_Lasambrian_orcs\" title=\"Declare peace with Lasambrian orcs\">offer of peace</a> from the Lasambrian orcs. The offer included an exchange of valuable materials for the remaining regions held by the invaders, with the understanding that their armies would cede the occupied regions and withdraw to the west. The majority of the Lasambrians occupying these regions withdrew back across the border. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn_military_concerns#Eastern_Sky\" title=\"Dawn military concerns\">Eastern Sky</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawn</a> quickly dealt with die-hard stragglers who refused to accompany the armies, and with several groups of outlaws who had taken advantage of the lack of Imperial presence to prey on their fellow citizens.</p><p>With Segura free of significant Lasambrian presence (until they <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_dead_tree_gives_no_shelter\" title=\"The dead tree gives no shelter\">returned as refugees</a> in 379YE), the Freeborn quickly returned to their old haunts. The agricultural wealth of Segura has already enriched the nation, allowing the opportunity to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_army#Maximum_numbers_of_Imperial_Armies\" title=\"Imperial army\">expand the Freeborn military</a> and build the first <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast_military_concerns#The_Freeborn_Storm\" title=\"The Brass Coast military concerns\">Imperial navy</a> in near 200 years.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anduz\">Anduz</span></h3><p>The largest town in Anduzjasse, built on the ruins of a much older settlement.

Many of the structures of Anduz incorporated elements of the older city which gave it a distinct aesthetic.</p><p>In Anduz, the Freeborn rubbed shoulders with traders from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Faraden\" title=\"Faraden\">Faraden</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Iron_Confederacy\" title=\"Iron Confederacy\">Iron Confederacy</a>, and there they acted as a trade gateway for the Empire. Anduz was sacked in 363YE and then burnt - only the stone structures survived. Fifteen years later, the shattered ruins of Anduz have become difficult to distinguish from the ruins of Old Anduz from which they were built.</p><p>One of the lucky survivors of the orcish destruction was the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura_spoils_of_war#Kabalai_Palace\" title=\"Segura spoils of war\">Kabalai Palace</a> which overlooks the city from the western hills. Built in a rare fusion of Freeborn and Faraden styles, this beautiful parador was claimed by the orcs but never razed - rather it was preserved as a residence by one of the Naguerro captains. With the swift advance of the Imperial forces, the parador was liberated in a lightning-quick raid by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn_military_concerns#The_Hounds_of_Glory\" title=\"Dawn military concerns\">Hounds of Glory</a> and has weathered its barbarian inhabitants surprisingly well.</p><p>Rebuilding work began in earnest almost as soon as the Lasambrian orcs were gone. Today, Anduz is reminiscent of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#Siroc\" title=\"Madruga\">Siroc</a> - a number of rebuilt structures surrounded by a sea of tents and pavilions. Construction of actual buildings has slowed significantly; there has been some discussion among residents about preserving many of the ruins of Anduz as testament to those who fell during the Lasambrian invasion of Segura, and encouraging more use of temporary structures both to reconnect with the nomadic roots of the Freeborn people and to honour the time many of the residents spent as homeless refugees during the occupation. </p><p>Shortly after the Summer Solstice 379YE, work was completed on a Faraden Embassy; the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambassador_to_Faraden\" title=\"Ambassador to Faraden\">ambassador</a> took up residence during the Autumn Equinox of that year.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anozel\">Anozel</span></h3><p>Once the economic centre of Segura, but since the invasion of 363YE, its hinterland is lost and its prosperity in tatters. Once-busy markets are quiet or given over to tented military encampments during the invasion of Segura. It survived as an armed camp, supported by regular caravans from Sobral and marked the westernmost border of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura#Sobral_Grasses\">Sobral Grasses</a>.</p><p>While Sobral is the elder of the two, Anozel had (until recently) eclipsed its younger sister in prosperity. Humorous stories and songs from the region often compared the two to disgruntled brothers - crotchety, traditional old Sobral and his younger, prettier brother Anozel whose amorous adventures invariably caused trouble for his elder sibling. The antics of the pair were often overseen and exacerbated by the mischievous middle sibling (representing Cerevado) and brought to an end by the intervention of the distant, powerful parent (Anduz). While they showed clear signs of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">League</a> literary influence, the tales themselves were often based on real historical political and economic conflicts between the settlements of Segura. Those stories and songs have fallen out of fashion since Segura fell, perhaps unsurprisingly.</p><p>The liberated town of Anozel is home to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura_spoils_of_war#Turunca_Distillery\" title=\"Segura spoils of war\">Turunca Distillery</a>. The distillery closed its doors in 366YE, partly due to the difficulty of securing good fruit in a war zone and partly due to the dissatisfaction of the owners with \"<i>the uncultured palates of soldiers who do not care if they are swilling fine orange brandy or Sarvosan dock-swill fancy fruit juice.</i>\" With the liberation of Segura, the distillery has re-opened, albeit under new management.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ghita.27s_Veils\">Ghita's Veils</span></h3><p>In the northern <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura#Sobral_Grasses\">Sobral Grasses</a> lie an enigmatic sequence of complex interlocking trenches a little under a foot deep called <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ghita%27s_Veils\" title=\"Ghita's Veils\">Ghita's Veils</a>. They sweep across a rough circle of grassland four miles in diameter. Granite basins of water are placed at several locations. While some are fed by freshwater streams, others must be filled manually, and many have been inlaid with mithril, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Weltsilver\" title=\"Materials\">weltsilver</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Orichalcum\" title=\"Materials\">orichalcum</a>. These basins collect crystal mana, and are carefully tended by a small group of hermits known as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ghita%27s_Veils#The_Quiet_Order\" title=\"Ghita's Veils\">the Quiet Order</a> who find the isolation and silence of Ghita's Veils particularly appealing.</p><p>The veils are exceedingly old and some historians believe they are of Terunael origin. According to scholars who have made a study of the area, there are some similarities between their design and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr_magical_traditions#Patterns\" title=\"Navarr magical traditions\">patterns</a> favoured by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Navarr\" title=\"Navarr\">Navarr</a>. The hermits mostly shrug, and say that they are what they are. Whoever Ghita was, and why this place is named for her veils, is uncertain.</p><p>Prior to the Spring Equinox 382YE, there were a number of six-foot pillars of basalt, smoothed and shaped by the elements, scattered seemingly at random across the design. This changed when an earthquake shook the entire Sobral Grasses, centred on Ghita's Veils. Each of the basalt pillars cracked and broke. Some still stand, but most fell into rubble. At the same time, many of the ditches collapsed, while others filled with water from some heretofore unknown aquifer. The design, whatever its purpose, was fundamentally disrupted. </p><p>The hermits still tend Ghita's Veils, and it is still a source of crystal mana, but there is little doubt that the place has changed on some essential level.

After the Lasambrian orcs were driven from the southern regions by Imperial forces, and ceded control of the northern regions to the Empire in return for a ceasefire, merchants both domestic and foreign turned their attention to repairing the towers.</p><p>In Winter 378YE, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rebuild_the_Towers_of_Anduz\" title=\"Rebuild the Towers of Anduz\">motion</a> to rebuild the towers was brought before the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Senate</a> by Avisena i Ezmara i Guerra, the new Senator for the liberated Segura.

By the start of Summer 379YE, the towers were once again garrisoned by Imperial troops and the trade routes to the west and south potentially viable once again.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Iron_Qanat\">Iron Qanat</span></h3><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zemress_islander\" title=\"Zemress islander\">Zemress Islanders</a> have extensively settled in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura#Sobral_Grasses\">Sobral Grasses</a> - but it is clear that these lands are not as fertile as those they are used to. Long, dry summers leave the crops parched and water-starved. To combat this, the Islanders <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Free_to_live#Yellow_Grain\" title=\"Free to live\">proposed</a> a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_work\" title=\"Great work\">great work</a> - the <b>Iron Qanat</b> - a system of reinforced irrigation ditches which have transformed the sandy soils of the Grasses into productive farmland that rivals the fertile lands of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marchers</a> to the north. After a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Judged_by_their_company#The_Iron_Qanat\" title=\"Judged by their company\">controversial false start</a> the Qanat was completed following the Summer Solstice 383YE.</p><p>The Iron Qanat is an ambitious design that provides water to every farm in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Territory#Region\" title=\"Territory\">region</a> allowing the Islanders <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> to produce much more than they can possibly consume themselves. The Qanat also includes fresh irrigation channels for many other farms in the area including two of the most prominent - the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura_spoils_of_war#The_Red_Fields\" title=\"Segura spoils of war\">Red Fields</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura_spoils_of_war#The_Golden_Terraces\" title=\"Segura spoils of war\">Golden Terraces</a>. The only drawback might be the vulnerability of the system.

At the time it was established, a blight effecting what little gloaming production the Faraden possess meant that the merchants were prepared to exchange large amounts of valuable mithril for the sought-after dyes.

Apparently established by one of the three founders of the Brass Coast, no historian has yet proved conclusively if it was laid out by Guerra, Erigo or Riqueza - nor which of the sisters corresponds to Hermaa Suspire in whose name it is dedicated. The Garden is considered a prize by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hakima\" title=\"Hakima\">hakima</a> of Segura, and in folklore custodianship brings with it the mixed blessings of the Sister of Sighs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anozeseri\">Anozeseri</span></h3><p>The sweeping plains of Anozeseri were home to some of the richest farmland in Segura, and a lot of the wealth of Anozel was tied up in the agriculture here.

When Anozeseri was liberated during the Winter of 377YE, these freedom fighters joined the triumphant armies of the Red Wind Corsairs and the Hounds of Glory in sweeping out the Lasambrian presence here - the most prominent are probably the band known as the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura_spoils_of_war#The_Morning_Swords\" title=\"Segura spoils of war\">Morning Swords</a>, who have found the warrior lifestyle to be much more appealing than a life of farming.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Burnish\">Burnish</span></h3><p>Nestled between three tributaries of the Scorrero, Burnish is something of a hinterland.

The ranch stubbornly resisted the Lasambrians for most of the war, using its defensive position between two tributaries of the Scorrero to draw raiding orcs into costly traps.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Iron_Plains\">Iron Plains</span></h3><p>Central Segura is somewhat more arid than the rest of the territory. The site of multiple battles throughout Freeborn history, farmers and herders here occasionally turned up the odd valuable relic of a past invasion. For the most parts, the Iron Plains are wide, empty and windswept. A place to come from or pass through, rather than a place to live. The dry soil is littered with battlefields, which makes it surprisingly fertile for the cultivation of certain herbs, especially <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marrowort\" title=\"Marrowort\">marrowort</a>, and the extensive well-irrigated <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura_spoils_of_war#The_Red_Fields\" title=\"Segura spoils of war\">Red Fields</a>, one of the best-known <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Herb_garden\" title=\"Herb garden\">gardens</a> in Segura, are rightly praised for the quality of their plants.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lucksprings\">Lucksprings</span></h3><p>The settlement of <b>Cerevado</b> is still a major pull. Sited at a particularly difficult set of rapids on the Scorrero. Some captains will unload their cargo, and push their boats along a league of rollers set into the rocky bank. Braver captains will pilot the foaming water and risk the rapids - and who amongst the Brass Coast would admit to anything other than daring of the highest order? The wreckage of those who failed is for sale in the Cerevado market. The settlement itself is also home to more than two dozen casinos and gambling houses - initially set up to cater to sailors traversing the rapids, but eventually exerting a much wider draw with gamblers from as far afield as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg\" title=\"Holberg\">Holberg</a> visiting the bustling town to engage in the annual tournaments of dice and counters. Unlike the rest of Segura, Cervado continued to prosper through the Lasambrian occupation - off-duty soldiers and mercenaries rubbed shoulders with desperate refugees looking for the money to escape and start again. </p><p>Reports have repeatedly come before the Synod of a predatory cult of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Malign_spiritual_presences#Hope\" title=\"Malign spiritual presences\">heretics</a> based in Lucksprings who prey on the needy and the desperate; to date no real evidence has been found despite claims from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura_spoils_of_war#House_of_the_Two_Moons\" title=\"Segura spoils of war\">House of the Two Moons</a> - the large <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Congregation\" title=\"Congregation\">congregation</a> centred in Cerevado - to the contrary.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sobral_Grasses\">Sobral Grasses</span></h3><p>The Sobral Grasses are the site of two key settlements - the armed camp that now occupies the town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura#Anozel\">Anozel</a> and the town of <b>Sobral</b> where the herds were once brought for slaughter. Sobral kept Anozel alive through the recent occupation and guarded the bridge across the Scorrero into the eastern Brass Coast. Connected by a reasonably well-maintained road to its beleaguered sibling to the south-west, it allowed supplies of food and armaments to travel reasonably effectively. That very reliability was almost a liability, however - several key shipments were captured by raiders out of the Iron Plains, and attributed to \"orc spies\" in Sobral. Even with the liberation, it is one of the few places in the Brass Coast where the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Orcs\" title=\"Imperial Orcs\">Imperial Orcs</a> receive a frosty welcome. These raids also threatened the prosperity of the herders and cattle-ranches of the Sobral grassland. Several strains of plump Freeborn herd animals are threatened with extinction already and if the raids had continued it would not have been inconceivable that the herds would have become unable to sustain themselves.</p><p>Not everything in the Sobral grasses is about trade or cattle, however. It is also the site of the ancient earthworks known as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Segura#Ghita.27s_Veils\">Ghita's Veils</a>, an old and powerful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mana_site\" title=\"Mana site\">mana site</a> that scholars believe may be of Terunael origin. It is tended by a small group of magicians who find the isolation and mournful grasslands to be spiritually uplifting; during the Lasambrian invasion, its isolated position meant that it was largely overlooked by the orcs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Yellow_Chase\">Yellow Chase</span></h3><p>As with Burnish, parts of western Yellow Chase are quite rocky and uneven, and the soil is very poor. A \"Yellow Chase farmer\" is a slang term used in parts of Segura for a liar - especially someone lying about where their money has come from. The inhabitants had a bad reputation for banditry and theft. There are a few rumours that some of the families here may have collaborated with the barbarians in the past. The area served as a centre of power for the Lasambrian barbarians, and they had a great armed camp here from which raiding parties swept down onto the plains. The camp was not fortified - it seems the Lasambrians had little interest in building anything, least of all a castle. This armed camp was largely abandoned when the Lasambrians withdrew back into the western hills in the Autumn of 378YE, but there was still a small engagement between Dawnish scouts and some die-hard orcs who refused to leave Segura which ended in a decisive victory for the Empire.</p><p>One of the tributaries of the Scorrero river rises in the Lasambrian hills above Yellow Chase - the fast flowing <i>Ambergris</i> occasionally carries shards of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ilium\" title=\"Ilium\">ilium</a> out of the hills and from time to time a farmer will make a small fortune selling the star metal.</p><div style=\"float: right; width=300px; margin-right:10px; margin-left: 10px; clear: right;\"><table><tr><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Summit</th><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Elected</th></tr><tr><td>Spring Equinox 383YE</td><td>Yasmeen i Zabala i Erigo</td></tr><tr><td>Spring Equinox 382YE</td><td>Avisena i Ezmara i Guerra</td></tr><tr><td>Spring Equinox 381YE</td><td>Avisena i Ezmara i Guerra</td></tr><tr><td>Spring Equinox 380YE</td><td>Avisena i Ezmara i Guerra</td></tr><tr><td>Spring Equinox 379YE</td><td>Avisena i Ezmara i Guerra</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 378YE</td><td>Avisena i Ezmara i Guerra</td></tr></table></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_Senate_Elections\">Recent Senate Elections</span></h2><p>As an Imperial territory, Segura is represented by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> elected in the Spring.

The heart of the Heliopticon is here, making it a centre of communication for the Nation. The miracle of the Heliopticon is administered from this territory, and most spires maintain a series of prisms, lenses and mirrors atop their tallest roof in order to pass on the flickering messages that keep the nation in constant communication.</p><p>Many spires in Morrow inhabit some of the original buildings discovered on the mountaintops by the first Urizen to ascend the mountains. Large open buildings, with doorways and halls just larger than a human might need, they create a sense of open space that has set the pattern for all Urizen architecture.</p><p>Despite its great age Morrow moves inexorably forward, and many of its spires are undergoing constant reconstruction and improvement. It is said that \u201cno two days find the same Morrow\u201d as the Urizen constantly strive to perfect their land even further. A project may take a decade or even more to come to fruition, but the Urizen pride themselves on vision and their desire to perfect their world.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Following the Summer Solstice 382YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> armies poured across the southern borders of Morrow from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith\" title=\"Zenith\">Zenith</a>.

Navarri vates are known to visit here to exchange news and knowledge.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Highwatch\">Highwatch</span></h3><p>A citadel that focuses on military science and leadership rather than the combat skills of individuals. It is where the Urizen met Giovanni the Peacemaker to negotiate their incorporation into the Empire. </p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Weave\">The Weave</span></h3><p>A spire dedicated to the study of the Net of the Heavens, with particular importance to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_religious_beliefs#Illuminates\" title=\"Urizen religious beliefs\">illuminate</a> philosophy. The influential writer Arria wrote her influential treatise on illumination <i>A Light In Dark Places</i> here, a text that is still studied by her successors three centuries later. The spire overlooks <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow#The_Three_Watchers\" title=\"Morrow\">Three Watchers Pass</a>, whose creation was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/An_affirming_flame#The_Three_Watchers\" title=\"An affirming flame\">facilitated by Furia Severia</a>,  herself an outspoken supporter of the illuminate approach to virtue.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Eye_of_Morrow\">The Eye of Morrow</span></h3><p>A small lake at the foot of the mountain that holds the Canterspire. Famed as a place of meditation. The air in this valley is remarkably still, and sound carries a vast distance. A perhaps misleading message is carved into a rock that stands next to the lake - it is in the Imperial tongue, and simply states \"The Eye is Closed\". That message has been there as long as any can remember.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Halls_of_Knowledge_.28ruined.29\">The Halls of Knowledge (ruined)</span></h3><p><span id=\"The_Halls_of_Knowledge\"></span>When Zenith was added to the Empire, the Urizen proposed that the Empire should have a second seat of magical study, in addition to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#Lyceum\" title=\"Madruga\">Lyceum</a>. Rather than threaten the Lyceum, the new academy would help unite the magicians of Urizen and allow them to pool their magical lore for the benefit of the Empire. Instead of building their academy of magic around an existing spire, they created an entirely new one and called it the Halls of Knowledge. A number of respected theorists and seers travelled to the new academy, and a Provost was appointed to help co-ordinate their research - and to encourage other Urizen magicians to offer their assistance. It soon became known as a centre for prognostication and the study of Day magic - to this day some of the best diviners in the civil service spend time studying here to hone their abilities.</p><p>The college stood in the hills of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Clypion\" title=\"Zenith\">Clypion</a> until shortly after the Autumn Equinox 381YE when it <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Foggy_mountain_top#The_Halls_of_Knowledge\" title=\"Foggy mountain top\">vanished overnight</a> in an eerie fog bank. The majority of the faculty, students, and researchers had evacuated but a small number of them were left unaccounted for including Provost Octavius of the spire of the Auric Horizon. Two months later, on the last night of the full moon before the Winter Solstice, the Halls of Knowledge reappeared in Morrow, on the shores of one of the largest hot springs of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow#Peregro\" title=\"Morrow\">Peregro</a>. None of the buildings appeared to be any the worse for wear for the two months they had spent... elsewhere. The unaccounted for scholars, however, remained unaccounted for.</p><p>Shortly after its singular disappearance and reappearance, the college was destroyed by the invading Druj, its libraries burnt and many of its scholars killed or enslaved by the rampaging orcs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Heliopticon\">The Heliopticon</span></h3><p>A network of communication devices using bronze mirrors, maintained and used by Urizen since time out of mind.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Apprentice_Magicians.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Apprentice Magicians.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/b/b8/Apprentice_Magicians.jpg/400px-Apprentice_Magicians.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/b/b8/Apprentice_Magicians.jpg/600px-Apprentice_Magicians.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/b/b8/Apprentice_Magicians.jpg/800px-Apprentice_Magicians.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">If Zenith is the soul, then Morrow is the heart of Urizen.</div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Altis\">Altis</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />At the northernmost border of Urizen is the region of Altis, home to the citadel of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow#Highwatch\">Highwatch</a> and known for particularly rich <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Tempest_Jade\" title=\"Materials\">tempest jade</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a>. Many of the caves within the mountains here possess unique, resonant acoustics and several spires are positioned specifically to study or make use of these properties.<br /><br />The <b>Spire of the Canticle</b> is perhaps the most famous of these <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spire\" title=\"Spire\">spires</a>. Known for producing some of the most beautiful, haunting, and eerie music in the modern Empire, their finest works must be enjoyed in situ as they incorporate the esoteric acoustic effects provided by the echoing caves. Over many years the Spire of the Canticle has \"fine tuned\" the properties of the caves, creating the <i>Cathedral Cavern</i> deep within the cold stone of the mountains. A premier performing venue in the eastern Empire, those who know how to exploit the unique acoustics can produce truly remarkable musical performances. Unsurprisingly, Altis is a common destination for lovers of music and poetry from across the Empire.<br /><br />Numerous stories speak of crystals brought out from the deeper tempest jade mines that possess remarkable properties for storing and reproducing music created in their presence. These <i>songstones</i> are much sought after, but rarely mined. Experiments have shown that their magic is much stronger if they are left where they are found, and several chambers have been hollowed out around them to exploit their properties. Many of these caverns have (perhaps coincidentally) become strong <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> connected to the realms of Day, Night, and occasionally Summer.<br /></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Caeli\">Caeli</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The towering peaks of Caeli are not the tallest in Urizen - those are in Zenith - but their beauty is unparalleled. On a clear day, an observer can gaze across the entire territory. The <b>Seat of the Arbiter</b> is a unique magical location that takes advantage of this property; a carved stone throne at the heart of a powerful regio tied to the realm of Day. Any magician who sits in the chair can gain a bird's eye view of any location in Morrow. The <b>Spire of the Arbiter's Seat</b> protected and oversaw the regio and its divinatory treasure until it was captured by the Druj invaders shortly before the Autumn Equinox 382YE. The magicians here were well-known for being excellent hosts and inveterate gossips.</p><p>On the tallest mountain in Caeli once stood the tower heart of the entire Heliopticon network and the spires and citadels that were devoted to its study, function, maintenance and protection. The attendants at the tower chose to destroy it in an invoked devastation, probably with the aid of the eternal <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kimus\" title=\"Kimus\">Kimus</a>, rather than let it fall into the hands of the Druj.<br /><br />The <b>Gardens of Morrow</b> once stood on the lower slopes of Caeli; like the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Head_Gardener_of_Urizen#The_Gardens_of_Pallas\" title=\"Head Gardener of Urizen\">Gardens of Pallas</a> before them, they were looted and then burnt to the ground by the Druj.</p><p>Between the Heliopticon heart and the Seat of the Arbiter, it is no surprise that Caeli had more than its fair share of magicians with have an interest in communication, magical and mundane. As such, these spires are not for those whose study needs demand quiet contemplation or solitude. Sadly these magicians were forced to flee ahead of the Druj advance leaving their precious library of divination and magical theory behind to the merciless orcs.<br /></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Operus\">Operus</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />This region boasts some of the oldest spires in Urizen, including <b>The Weave</b>.

They are credited as being the source of the school of thought that believes that places as well as people and events act as nodes in the net, and that particularly significant locations could be identified through <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Astronomancy\" title=\"Astronomancy\">study of the stars</a>.<br /><br />Operus is also the site of the <b>Auric Horizon</b>, an influential spire known for its expertise with the divinations of both Day and Night. Politically active, the spire is occasionally linked with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Religious_Crimes#Heresy\" title=\"Religious Crimes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">heretical philosophies</a> that have caused friction with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Synod</a> in the past. The alleged \"prophet\" (or charlatan, depending who one asks) <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Abraxus\" title=\"Abraxus\">Abraxus Whitespire</a> spent his last years here, and it is said to have been where he wrote the Abraxian prophecies. In the centuries since, successive firebrands and especially <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambition\" title=\"Ambition\">ambitious</a> mages have secured Auric Horizon's reputation for involvement (and occasionally interference) in Imperial affairs.<br /></p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Canterspire_Circle\" title=\"Canterspire Circle\">Canterspire Circle</a>, a rich weirwood forest, grows on the lower slopes of Operus. One of the richest spires in Urizen, the <b>Spire of Golden Wood</b> overlooks the forest, and owns some of the richest <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farms</a> and beggarwood <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forests</a> in Urizen. They are widely known both for their fine quality mutton, and for the delicate yellow dyes they prepare using the heather that grows in great profusion around their homes. Indeed, many of the spires of Operus are known for a signature dye, or type of leather.<br /></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Peregro\">Peregro</span></h3><p>Peregro is one of the most volatile regions of Morrow, known for several hot springs and even a few superheated geysers. Several spires harness the waters to provide heating, or make a study of the complex currents that run beneath the surface of the earth. Magicians theorise that there is a great deal of subterranean activity in this region, and predict that one day - probably far in the future - they might lead to a serious disaster - perhaps even a volcanic eruption.</p><p>After the Summer Solstice 382YE, the Druj invaded across the southern border from Zenith crushing and enslaving everything in their path. They destroyed the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Keeper_of_the_Glorious_Fountain\" title=\"Keeper of the Glorious Fountain\">Glorious Fountain of Dawn and Dusk</a>, tearing it apart and permanently damaging the pool above which it stood.

The peaks are lower here and many spires are actually built in the foothills; only <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Siluri\">Mount Siluri</a> comes close to matching the splendour of the peaks of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith\" title=\"Zenith\">Zenith</a> to the north.

Most of the coast is made up of white stone cliffs, unwelcoming and inhospitable; only as the land slopes down towards <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis\" title=\"Necropolis\">Necropolis</a> and the river Couros does Redoubt possess many beaches.</p><p>The mountains here are riddled with odd star-shaped tunnels that date back thousands of years, long before there were any reliable records of humans in this part of the world. Scholars have spent centuries trying to tease some truth about these tunnels from the cold stone - are they a natural phenomena? Signs of pre-human habitation of the mountains? The result of some magical working? To date, no convincing explanation has been offered, and philosophers on all sides argue heatedly about their provenance.</p><p>Redoubt is lightly settled, even for Urizen, with many of the more prosperous spires being built along the coast, or overlooking the banks of the Couros river to the west. Unsurprisingly, there are many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_military_concerns\" title=\"Urizen military concerns\">citadels</a> here and a strong martial tradition, but this is also a territory that produces more than its fair share of zoologists and botanists. These natural philosophers are sometimes blamed for the more esoteric animals and plants found here, and the occasional mutated hybrid horror that appears here is often a sign that a magician is straying dangerously close to insanity.</p><p>Parts of the lowlands are quite dangerous - and not just because of these mutated experiments. Several bands of orcs bandits live in the spaces between the spires, and barely a year goes by without a nest of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Trogoni\" title=\"Trogoni\">trogoni</a> or a den of drakes becoming a nuisance.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Since 331YE and the barbarian conquest of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral\" title=\"Spiral\">Spiral</a>, Redoubt has been preparing itself for invasion. Its long coastline is something of a liability against the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Grendel\" title=\"Grendel\">Grendel</a>, but for now a combination of sheer cliffs, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast\" title=\"The Brass Coast\">Freeborn</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Corsair\" title=\"Corsair\">corsairs</a> and Urizen's own small fleet of martially inclined vessels have prevented the barbarians achieving much more than a few small raids along the shores of the Bay of Catazar.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cargo\">Cargo</span></h3><p>Perhaps the most advanced port in all the Empire, Cargo is built on high cliffs overlooking the river Couros in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Limus\">Limus</a> foothills. Built on multiple gradated levels and sheer cliffs, it is truly a remarkable settlement. Food from the pampas of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast\" title=\"The Brass Coast\">Brass Coast</a> and the distant <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marches</a>, as well as luxuries from cities of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">League</a> and even raw materials from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushka</a> all pass through Cargo - along with travellers from both the Empire and distant foreign lands. Its wealth owes a lot to the remarkable cranes - both those that speed the process of loading and unloading visiting river boats, and those allowing great quantities of imported goods and exports of stone and metal ore to be winched from the riverside docks to the cliffside heights. As befits a town built on several levels, Cargo is also a centre for the stuff of civil engineering - and of those applications of ritual magic that enhance or support the creation of durable structures. There is some rivalry with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard\" title=\"Highguard\">Highborn</a> town of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Hedra\" title=\"Necropolis\">Hedra</a> on the other side of the river, and historical rivalry with coastal spires such as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Elos\">Elos</a> and lost <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Apulus\" title=\"Spiral\">Apulian</a>. </p><h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Embassies_of_Cargo\">The Embassies of Cargo</span></h4><p>Cargo is home to three separate international embassies with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Principalities_of_Jarm\" title=\"Principalities of Jarm\">Principalities of Jarm</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Axos\" title=\"Axos\">Citadels of Axos</a>, and the merchants of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarcophan_Delves\" title=\"Sarcophan Delves\">Sarcophan Delves</a>. The establishment of these three embassies has seen Cargo far outstrip its rivals in terms of prosperity, but created a few problems of its own as an increase in transient population places previously unknown pressure on the town to expand. An example of this prosperity are the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prime_Factor_of_the_Pallas_Docks#Pallas_Docks\" title=\"Prime Factor of the Pallas Docks\">Pallas Docks</a>, not far from the Jarmish embassy, which secures a weirwood trade route with the Magician-Prince of P\u04d3rnau Principality in Eastern Jarm.</p><p>In Summer 378YE work began on the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambassador_to_Jarm\" title=\"Ambassador to Jarm\">Jarmish embassy</a> on one of the upper tiers. A beautiful, airy construction of white granite and weirwood with an extensive (and expensive) gardens as well as several private apartments, work was overseen by Atte, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">Senator</a> for Sermersuaq. A reciprocal embassy was built in the distant port of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Principalities_of_Jarm_ports#Rigia_.28Eastern_Principalities_of_Jarm.29\" title=\"Principalities of Jarm ports\">Rigia</a>, following intense discussion between Oswi Twice-Burned and the representatives of the Jarmish House of Princes.</p><p>The Jarmish embassy was joined by an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambassador_to_Axos\" title=\"Ambassador to Axos\">embassy</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Axos\" title=\"Axos\">citadels of Axos</a> shortly before the Autumn Equinox 380YE. In contrast to the embassy to the magician-princes, the embassy to the masters of the <i>necromantia</i> is a six storey structure of white granite, with a wide base that tapers toward the roof-garden that crowns it. It was designed with the assistance of architects from the Towers of Kantor, and in much the same way Urizen architects were extensively consulted before work began on the Imperial Embassy in Axos. Some minor controversy has been sparked by the inclusion of a half dozen mummified corpses in the chambers beneath the embassy, said variously to be deceased relatives of the ambassador ... or members of the ambassadorial staff, depending on who one asks.</p><p>At the same time the embassy to Axos was being built, work was also proceeding on an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Ambassador_to_the_Sarcophan_Delves\" title=\"Ambassador to the Sarcophan Delves\">embassy</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarcophan_Delves\" title=\"Sarcophan Delves\">Sarcophan Delves</a>. Three squat towers connected by covered walkways surround a central garden notable for its riotous profusion of exotic herbs and the glass roof that covers it, allowing the often-delicate plants to prosper in the otherwise inhospitable climate of western Urizen. The embassy has spilled over into Moonfall Square, an open area previously used by musicians and artists, which is now increasingly dominated by an impromptu market as merchants from all over the Empire (and beyond) come to bargain with the traders from Sarcophan. Due to the presence of five official ambassadors, and their staff, all trying to inhabit as single embassy, many of the buildings around the square have also been bought up by Sarcophan citizens leading to one <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Marches\" title=\"The Marches\">Marcher</a> wag dubbing it \"Little Delving\". The garrulous Sarcophan enthusiasm for trading and street-culture has already made some of the Urizen citizens in the area a little uneasy - an unease that can only grow thanks to the completion of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bewaarder_van_het_Vandersar_dok#The_Concordium_Dock\" title=\"Bewaarder van het Vandersar dok\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Concordium Dock</a> and the concomitant increase in the number of Sarcophan merchants coming to Cargo.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Walls_of_Cargo\">The Walls of Cargo</span></h3><p>Commissioned in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_Cargo\" title=\"Fortify Cargo\">Spring 382YE</a>, the fortified walls of Cargo are the result of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_whole_world#An_Opportunity_in_Cargo\" title=\"The whole world\">cooperation between four</a> nations. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_whole_world#The_Builders_of_Axos\" title=\"The whole world\">Designed</a> by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Axos\" title=\"Axos\">Axou</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_whole_world#The_Wealth_of_Sarcophan\" title=\"The whole world\">partially financed</a> by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarcophan_Delves\" title=\"Sarcophan Delves\">Sarcophan Delves</a>, and built by the Empire with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_whole_world#The_Magic_of_Jarm\" title=\"The whole world\">magical assistance</a> from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Principalities_of_Jarm\" title=\"Principalities of Jarm\">Principalities of Jarm</a>, their construction was intended to protect the town - and its embassies - from the threat of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Druj\" title=\"Druj\">Druj</a> invasion.</p><p>The fortification has a distinctly Axou appearance. Unlike Imperial fortifications, Axou castles and forts include extensive provisions for injuring and killing attacking soldiers rather than just protecting the settlement itself. The Axou embassy provides expert engineers and additional soldiers to the garrison, ensuring that these provisions are well maintained - and can be deployed to their best effect in the event of a siege. </p><p>Enlarging the fortification while keeping these unique features would represent a challenge, without the aid of an Axou architect or someone versed in their techniques, or an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Appraisal\" title=\"Appraisal\">appraisal</a> by the civil service.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Delving\">Delving</span></h3><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Headdress2.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Urizen Headdress\"><img alt=\"Urizen Headdress\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/c/cd/Headdress2.jpg/200px-Headdress2.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/c/cd/Headdress2.jpg/300px-Headdress2.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/c/cd/Headdress2.jpg/400px-Headdress2.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\"></div></div><p>One of the best known spires in Redoubt is found in the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Tomari\">Tomari</a> peaks.

Although it is still a place of study, its wealth is based on <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mining</a> and the principles of engineering when it comes to mining. Adventuresome <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark\" title=\"Wintermark\">Winterfolk</a> often come here to teach and to study, and it is considered a pre-eminent site for Urizen study of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Runes\" title=\"Runes\">runic</a> tradition of magic. Prior to the fall of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Holberg\" title=\"Holberg\">Holberg</a>, the university there maintained a traditional exchange program where students from the city would spend some time studying in the rarefied atmosphere of Redoubt, or travel north to the cosmopolitan halls of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">League</a> academia.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Court_of_the_White_Fountain\">The Court of the White Fountain</span></h3><p>Built in the foothills of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Optarion\">Optarion</a>, the Court of the White Fountain is a single massive tower of white granite surrounded by a massive semi-circular wall that completely fills one of the few major passes between Redoubt and the Broken Shore to the south, The White Fountain itself is a great plume of liquid fire that bursts from somewhere deep within the earth and cascades down into a black basin before the tower, before disappearing back beneath the ground. The great courtyards of the tower are sufficient to hold the entire armed forces of Urizen, and the open ground they represent creates a deadly killing field for the skilled Urizen archers who man the upper reaches of the tower and the walls.

It is surrounded by several low buildings that radiate out like spokes of a wheel. These outbuildings serve as classrooms, practice rooms, accommodation for both permanent residents and visitors, and a meditation area where the virtue of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Pride\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a> is contemplated. There is also a large building set aside as a library, which is slowly being populated with books and scrolls dedicated both to musical theory and (this being Urizen) to the practice of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Music_of_the_spheres\" title=\"Music of the spheres\">Music of the spheres</a>. It also boasts a large collection of music, favouring that of Urizen but including large numbers of scores contributed by other Imperial nations.

While most of the spires in Willstone are both isolated and isolationist, Willstone at least sees some traffic - and with the establishment of the Grand Conservatory of Music, it is expected to see a good deal more. The location was apparently chosen because it is close to the geographical \"centre of Urizen\" - at least on a map - but this creates its own problems. Willstone is known to be the territory of three established bands of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orc</a> brigands, and there is little doubt the Grand Conservatory represents a rich prize should they ever become organised enough to threaten it.

Today the spire is little more than a quiet fishing village, with most major trade passing it entirely in favour of the much larger ports of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Cargo\" title=\"Redoubt\">Cargo</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Hedrossan\" title=\"Necropolis\">Hedra</a> to the north. Despite its somnolent present, there are still a few reminders of its former purpose - the quayside is extensive and the harbour wall fortified in several places. The shipyard that once maintained a small fleet of weirwood vessels now services a few dozen fishing boats, but if the need were great its past glories might yet be restored.</p><p>At the highest point of the headland that looks out over the Bay of Catazar is <b>Rebekah's Leap</b>, the place where an eponymous <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_religious_beliefs#Stewards_of_the_dead\" title=\"Highguard religious beliefs\">steward of the dead</a> threw herself into the bay. Troubled in mind and spirit, she broke free from her attendants and hurled herself from the cliffs that bear her name after months convinced that she could hear the tolling of a great bell summoning her to the sea. Some fisherfolk of Elos still claim they can hear a bell in the deeps, from time to time.<br /></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Optarion\">Optarion</span></h3><p>The unsettled hills of Optarion quickly give way to a broad band of scrubby coast. Cliffs line the coast, and those few places where the walls of stone drop down towards sea level are the site of well defended Urizen port-spires. Indeed, Optarion is home to some of the best-defended spires in modern Urizen. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#The_Court_of_the_Fountain\">Court of the Fountain</a> stands here, guarding the approach into Redoubt through <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral\" title=\"Spiral\">Spiral</a> and the peaks are scattered with fortified citadels, many hastily defended in the wake of the fall of Spiral, who have been engaged in irregular border skirmishes with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Grendel\" title=\"Grendel\">Grendel</a>. Most of the other spires are built along the coast - and likewise tend to possess unexpectedly strong defences in the face of barbarian raids along the coast. </p><p>The largest non-martial spire in the south-east is <b>Visten</b>, a port built around three soaring towers occupying a strip of land that plunges down to the sea. It brings produce from across the Empire to the southern spires. It is a thriving community, home to those Urizen who find life in the mountains too stifling and want more contact with the wider world. It has one of the largest populations of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Briar\" title=\"Briar\">briars</a> in Urizen, and its population has been swelled by refugees - and ships - from southern Spiral, especially those who managed to escape the fall of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Apulus\" title=\"Spiral\">Apulian</a>. </p><p>One notable feature of Visten that attracts scholars and sight-seers alike is a potent <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> tied to the realm of Spring that lies on the Bay of Catazar itself - a ring of turbulent water that erupts once or twice every week into a great waterspout that reaches several hundred feet into the air. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bands#Covens\" title=\"Bands\">Covens</a> making use of this regio, called the <b>Ribbon of Salt</b> by the locals, find their rituals unexpectedly interrupted, occasionally with tragic consequences - the violent water shatters pontoons, rafts and small vessels with equal ease in its active state.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Siluri\">Siluri</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The entire region takes its name from Mount Siluri, which rises majestically toward heavens and rivals the peaks of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith\" title=\"Zenith\">Zenith</a> in height. The central tower of Redoubt's <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_culture_and_customs#The_Heliopticon\" title=\"Urizen culture and customs\">Heliopticon</a> is built here, gazing down on the forested bowl of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Ventosi\">Ventosi</a> to one side and across the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis\" title=\"Necropolis\">Necropolis</a> to the other. Several <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a> exploit the bounty of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Tempest_Jade\" title=\"Materials\">tempest jade</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Weltsilver\" title=\"Materials\">weltsilver</a> that lies beneath the peaks, but it is also home to a number of spires who study and expand the philosophies of war and conflict in their myriad incarnations.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tomari\">Tomari</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The wild peaks of Tomari are some of the more populous in Redoubt. The mountains are riddled with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a>, and rich in iron, precious metals, fine jewels and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Green_Iron\" title=\"Materials\">green iron</a>. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#The_Brilliant_Star\">Brilliant Star</a> is found here, and occasional pockets of mithril are found throughout the peaks. It is also the site of the famous spire of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Delving\">Delving</a>, whose prosperity is based on rich mines and the study of subterranean engineering.</p><p>Among other notable spires, <b>Tabulous</b> is a college whose curriculum focuses on teaching rigorous objectivity and complex mathematics. Many members of the faculty are retired Urizen civil servants, and the curriculum is considered excellent for training servants of the Empire, giving them the skills to make accurate accountings and forecasts. The Day <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> in which Tabulous stands is credited both with cultivating an atmosphere of calm and rationality, and making the spire especially welcoming to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Merrow\" title=\"Merrow\">merrow</a> scholars.</p><p>On the highest peak here stands the fused ruin known as the <b>Unmade</b>. A crumbled tower of blasted stone, it is said that it once was a spire, that was eradicated completely by the massed Spires of Urizen early in the days of the Empire. No-one remembers why - which in a nation dedicated to the keeping of accurate records is a matter of obvious concern.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ventosi\">Ventosi</span></h3><p>The valleys of Ventosi form a great shallow basin between the towering peaks to the north, east and south. Wild forests haunted by surly orcs and hungry <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Drakes\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">drakes</a> give way to fertile <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Farm\" title=\"Farm\">farmland</a> nearer the rocky coast, where sheer white stone cliffs drop vertiginously into the Bay of Catazar. These western cliffs, haunted by massive gulls and wild sea birds, give Ventosi the feeling of a secluded plateau rather than a valley. A few ambitious spires built along the coast use lifts and treacherous paths to access the water, while others are constructed into the rock walls themselves gazing out towards the Brass Coast. The cliffs of Ventosi are the only known nesting grounds within the empire of the Imperial Albatross - some specimens have been reported with wingspans of almost twenty feet.</p><p>One of the more prominent spires here is called <b>The Hollows</b>, for its unusual construction: wind-blown caves in the sandstone formed into extensive dwellings by years of patient, meditative, stone-carving. It is exceptional in Redoubt as a place of spiritual study and introspection. The nature of time is a particular topic discussed here and the surrounding area is scattered with large works of sculpture left to the mercy of the elements.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Willstone\">Willstone</span></h3><p>The slopes of north-eastern Redoubt are heavily wooded, with hardy conifers on the upper slopes and sprawling <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forests</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Beggar.27s_Lye\" title=\"Materials\">beggarwood</a> on the lower slopes. There are comparatively few spires here, and they tend to be both isolated and isolationist, keeping contact with their peers largely through the heliopticon. This has contributed somewhat to Willstone also being the home of at least three small bands of independent barbarian <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orc</a> brigands who occasionally bedevil travellers or launch a (generally unsuccessful) raid against one of the smaller spires. The best known spire in the region is probably <b>Willstone</b>.Built largely of wood on the lower slopes of the mountain, surrounding a central carved stone pillar worked with many runes. Whatever other properties it may possess, the runic pillar is known to be a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Formulaic_ritual#Ritual_Texts\" title=\"Formulaic ritual\">ritual text</a> for <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bound_by_Common_Cause\" title=\"Bound by Common Cause\">Bound by Common Cause</a>, and the anchor for a strong Autumn <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a>.

Only the fact the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Halls_of_Knowledge\">Halls of Knowledge</a> had been moved under mysterious circumstances a few months previously prevented them from capturing (and presumably destroying) it. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Head_Gardener_of_Urizen#The_Gardens_of_Pallas\" title=\"Head Gardener of Urizen\">Gardens of Pallas</a> however were not so fortunate; the Druj looted and then burnt them to the ground.</p><p>Apart from a few isolated spires hidden beneath veils of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Night_magic\" title=\"Night magic\">Night magic</a>, much of the population of Zenith has been displaced. Refugees fled to Redoubt and Morrow, while those who remained behind were enslaved by the Druj. The loss of life in Zenith was much smaller than it could have been - the courageous defence of the territory by the Highborn armies allowed many who might otherwise have fallen into the hands of the eastern orcs to escape that dread fate.</p><p>Following the Winter Solstice 382YE, a daring raid was launched into Zenith by a combination of Urizen sentinels, Highborn soldiers, heralds, and Imperial heroes from several nations. Its aim was to free as many prisoners from the Druj as possible. The raid was a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/383YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Zenith\" title=\"383YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">resounding success</a> and almost two-thirds of those trapped in Zenith were liberated including over seven hundred Highborn soldiers and more than two hundred sentinels who later went on to join the Citadel Guard.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arch_of_the_Sky\">Arch of the Sky</span></h3><p>Before the Druj invastion of 381YE, the Arch of the Sky was a collection of spires on the tallest mountain in Zenith. Stargazers and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Astronomancy\" title=\"Astronomancy\">astronomancers</a> from all of Empire gathered here to observe the night skies, and debate the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Net_of_the_Heavens\" title=\"Net of the Heavens\">Net of the Heavens</a>. One of the most prestigious schools of astronomancy, it was also one of the finest observatories in Urizen, if not the Empire.</p><p>The flood waters unleashed by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Winter_Solstice_winds_of_war#Hunting_By_The_Rivers\" title=\"381YE Winter Solstice winds of war\">destruction of the Golden Cascade</a> did not reach the spire itself of course, but even as the dam was being smashed apart Druj guerillas were moving into position. Many of the astronomancers and star-watchers had already retreated, but a handful of magicians and sentinels remained behind in the hope of holding the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orc</a> invaders at bay. Such hope was in vain. Less than a week after the Autumn Equinox, the eastern orcs captured and looted the Arch of the Sky. What they could not carry away was reduced to ashes and broken ruins.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Medea_Ruth.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Medea Ruth.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/6/61/Medea_Ruth.jpg/300px-Medea_Ruth.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/6/61/Medea_Ruth.jpg/450px-Medea_Ruth.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/6/61/Medea_Ruth.jpg/600px-Medea_Ruth.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">The Halls of Knowledge expand the Empire's understanding<br />of magical lore.</div></div><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Endsmeet\">Endsmeet</span></h3><p>This spire in south-western <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Occursion\">Occursion</a> studied interaction between people, and had particular interest in times of political turmoil in the Empire. It was home to refugees from Spiral, particularly those who brought with them the great library of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Ankarien\" title=\"Spiral\">Ankarien</a>. Sadly, when the Druj invaded they quickly overwhelmed the spire. Many of the Urizen living there managed to escape, but the library was burned and those who did not flee were either killed or enslaved by the ruthless eastern orcs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bountiful_Autumn\">Bountiful Autumn</span></h3><p>The lakes of Zenith are deep, but of particular interest are the two bodies of water known together as \"Bountiful Autumn\". Found in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Occursion\">Occursion</a>, their shores were once regarded as a particularly fortuitous place to marry for the success of the new family. Although modern Urizen have found little support for these claims, it is worth noting that the lakes lie within a strong <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> tied to the Autumn realm. To this day, it is still traditional to eat fish from the lakes at a wedding, or to present them (fresh or cooked) as gifts to particularly close friends. Ritual magic used to create bonds between individuals is said to be especially potent when performed at these lakes, or using pure water gathered from their depths at certain specific times of year (the exact times are closely guarded secrets shared only by the spires that stand on the mountainsides above the lakes).</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Clypion\">Clypion</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The passes between Clypion and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Proceris\">Proceris</a> house a cluster of spires keen to take advantage of the relative seclusion of their foothills. The spires are all \"related\" - formed initially by settlers originating in the nearby <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Arch_of_the_Sky\">Arch of the Sky</a>, and later by successive generations gathered from among these daughter-spires as their populations grew. The spires of the \"Clypion Alliance\" maintain cordial relations, and each tends to specialise in study of impractical esoterica. Critics suggest that the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_magical_traditions#Mages\" title=\"Urizen magical traditions\">mages</a> of Clypion see practical applications of theory or magic as somehow beneath them. There have been spires devoted to the study of boundaries, of ageing, of ceremonies, of symbols, and perhaps most recursively, to the study of the studies of other spires...<br /><br />Several of the older spires are starting to feel a little crowded, and it is likely that a new spire will be formed within the next few years - there is likely to be fierce competition between the Clypion spires to determine the location and focus of this new spire.<br /><br />The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Provost_of_the_Halls_of_Knowledge\" title=\"Provost of the Halls of Knowledge\">Halls of Knowledge</a> once stood high in the mountains of Clypion. One of the greatest Imperial <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/College_of_Magic\" title=\"College of Magic\" class=\"mw-redirect\">colleges</a> dedicated to the study of magic, it attracted students, lecturers, and magical theoreticians from across the Empire. Shortly after the Autumn Equinox 381YE, however, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Foggy_mountain_top#The_Halls_of_Knowledge\" title=\"Foggy mountain top\">the college vanished</a>. It reappeared shortly before the Winter Solstice, relocated to the volcanic pools of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow#Peregro\" title=\"Morrow\">Peregro</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow\" title=\"Morrow\">Morrow</a>. The Provost at the time, Octavius of the Auric Horizon, disappeared along with the college - and did not reappear when the buildings were relocated. He returned several months later, none the worse for his experience, with no memory of the intervening time.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Iteri\">Iteri</span></h3><p>The plains of Iteri in western Zenith are home to the river Utique, a tributary of the Couros which flows from <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt\" title=\"Redoubt\">Redoubt</a> in the south. The land here is rich in fine clay and valuable <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Dragonbone\" title=\"Materials\">dragonbone</a> deposits, both of which contribute to a reputation for producing beautiful ceramics. Iteri also boasted the ancient <b>Spire Calator</b> near the foot of <b>Mount Lutum</b>, where the secrets of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_economic_interests#Ushabti\" title=\"Urizen economic interests\">ushabti</a> production are believed to have first been codified. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Crafting_skills#Artisan\" title=\"Crafting skills\">artisans</a> of Urizen once gathered here to study and perfect the craft of these valuable magical constructs. The spire was known as much for its art as for the practical application of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Magic_items\" title=\"Magic items\">artificer's craft</a>. Some <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_magical_traditions#Mages\" title=\"Urizen magical traditions\">mages</a> sent their students to Spire Calator specifically to study the arts of formal debate at this famously argumentative spire. An ongoing debate between those who favoured artistic form over practical function that had been going on for nearly 150 years without any clear victor ended abruptly when the Druj conquered the spire toward the end of 381YE. Most of the inhabitants were able to escape, thanks to the valiant action of Highborn soldiers.</p><p>Along the banks of the Couros stood the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Head_Gardener_of_Urizen\" title=\"Head Gardener of Urizen\">Gardens of Pallas</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sinecure\" title=\"Sinecure\">sinecure</a>. The Druj looted the gardens of their herbs, smashed the ushabti gardeners, and then burnt everything in a grand bonfire the smoke from which was visible in both Morrow and Redoubt.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lustri\">Lustri</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Forest<br />Lustri is heavily forested, and was once home to many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">carefully cultivated preserves</a>.

There are many stories of encounters between travelers and dangerous creatures such as the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Astronomancy#Tulpas\" title=\"Astronomancy\">tulpas</a> said to have escaped from the <b>Spire of Twisting Shadows</b>.</p><p>The Spire itself was an ancient structure dedicated to the treatment (and, functionally, incarceration) of those who suffer long term spiritual or mental damage due to exposure to magic. Most of the inmates are were voluntarily, but a few are restrained for their own safety. The spire had a grim reputation, unsurprisingly. A significant portion of the patients here had been hurt due to overuse or misuse of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Astronomancy\" title=\"Astronomancy\">astronomancy</a> - permanently twisted by exposure to a tulpa. The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Surgical_skills#Physick\" title=\"Surgical skills\">physics</a> of the Spire of Twisting Shadows has a great deal of practical experience dealing with magical <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Curse\" title=\"Curse\">curses</a> as well as more esoteric maladicaments, and was always interested in reports of new malign enchantments - or the opportunity to study them.<br /><br />In Summer 380YE, during the ascent of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Red_star\" title=\"Red star\">red star</a>, the Spire of Twisting Shadows <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sorrow_and_death\" title=\"Sorrow and death\">was destroyed</a> following a riot among the patients.

Sadly, it was not untouched by the Druj invasion and in Autumn 381YE confirmation came that the Druj had looted and destroyed it, robbing the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Anvil#The_Anvil_Hospital\" title=\"Anvil\">Anvil Hospital &amp; Imperial School of Medicine</a> of a valuable source of medicinal herbs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Occursion\">Occursion</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />More than any other region in Zenith, Occursion was home to spires dedicated to religious philosophy and many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_religious_beliefs#Illuminates\" title=\"Urizen religious beliefs\">illuminates</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_religious_beliefs#Illuminates\" title=\"Urizen religious beliefs\">questors</a> had their homes here. The northernmost slopes of these mountains enjoyed a particularly still, cold, dry air which was believed to aid contemplation, and focus the mind. Priests here practiced meditative arts and subtle magics that allow them to explore their own thoughts, and often receive unique insights into the natures of the virtues and the philosophies of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way\" title=\"The Way\">the Way</a>.

Sadly, the Tower was a casualty of the Druj invasion.

Since the reign of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Walter\" title=\"Emperor Walter\">Emperor Walter</a> they had been somewhat reticent about involving themselves in wider affairs - but during the reign of the late <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Empress_Britta\" title=\"Empress Britta\">Empress Britta</a> there were signs this spire was beginning to pay close attention to affairs of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Synod</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Senate</a> once more. Both spires were captured by the Druj during the 381YE invasion, and those Urizen who did not manage to flee are presumed either dead or enslaved.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Proceris\">Proceris</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Marsh, Ruined<br />Much of the region of Proceris lies in the shadows of the lofty peaks that surround it. While there were few spires here, there were settlements devoted to what little agriculture the Urizen and their <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_economic_interests#ushabti\" title=\"Urizen economic interests\">ushabti</a> could muster in this chilly climate. Proceris actually had a fascinating microclimate for those that are interested in such matters, with many frost hollows and sun traps that provide unique opportunities to the spires that live here. The region was sparsely populated, even for Urizen, and with the exception of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Arch_of_the_Sky\" title=\"Zenith\">Arch of the Sky</a> what spires there were tend to explore somewhat mundane, practical matters such as farming and economy. <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_economic_interests#Architects\" title=\"Urizen economic interests\">Architects</a> in particular often found reasons to visit or live in Proceris, and many of the magicians here focused their studies on the secrets of Spring and Autumn magic.</p><p>Perhaps the richest farmers in Urizen lived in Proceris, three spires that between them maintained and worked the <b>Golden Cascade</b> - a series of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.ukhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_%28agriculture%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\">terraces<i class=\"icon-share-alt\"></i></a> carved into the foothills and supported both with powerful ritual magic, expertly constructed aqueducts, and great polished mirrors that ensured that the fields here receive as much sunlight as possible all year round. The golden cascade was seen by many as a wonder of the Empire, and while it had been copied by a few other spires, there was no match for the size and fertility of this great farm anywhere in Urizen. Sadly, when the Druj came in 381YE they saw the Golden Cascade not as a wonder but as an opportunity. In Autumn of that year they unleashed a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marshwalkers\" title=\"Marshwalkers\">marshwalker</a> against the dam that channelled water into the aqueducts.

The main thrust of pre-Imperial Urizen settlement was in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow\" title=\"Morrow\">Morrow</a> to the north, and the two territories were connected by a tenuous \"bridge\" of spires stretching across <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith\" title=\"Zenith\">Zenith</a>. Even then, the place had a haunted reputation. At some point in the distant past, powerful magic was worked here and the echoes of that magic occasionally caused trouble for the Urizen in their mountain fastnesses.</p><p>At the heart of the territory is the <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span>, a great plateau of volcanic glass with a dire reputation. Artefacts from the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> are often considered haunted or touched by malign evil, and are generally destroyed when they are encountered. </p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span></h2><p>Spiral was lost to the Empire fifty years ago. In 331 YE. Barbarians from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Grendel\" title=\"Grendel\">Broken Shore</a> came up through <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Apulus\">Apulus</a> along the coast, and with weapons fashioned from the glass taken from the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> overran the defenders of Spiral, resisting all efforts to throw them back. Refugees streamed into <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Morrow\" title=\"Morrow\">Morrow</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith\" title=\"Zenith\">Zenith</a>, and many of them - and their descendants - live there to this day. Some still consider themselves to be living in exile and consider the liberation of Spiral a pressing concern.</p><p>With the restoration of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Fort_Mezudan.2C_.E2.80.9CThe_Fist.E2.80.9D\">Fort Mezudan</a>, Imperial eyes are once again on Spiral. Identifying a weakness in the Grendel supply lines, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/378YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_war#Dawn\" title=\"378YE Summer Solstice winds of war\">concerted campaign of seaborne raiding</a> was followed in Autumn by the invocation of a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/378YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#The_Tempest\" title=\"378YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">cataclysmic storm</a> that devastated the docks at <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Apulus\">Apulian</a>. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on barbarian domination here.</p><p>In Spring 381YE, the Grendel orcs launched a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/381YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Patterns_of_Force_.28Spiral.29\" title=\"381YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">major offensive</a> on all fronts that saw Imperial forces driven back to Cinion, and the territory again fell into barbarian hands. Over the next year, war raged relentlessly across the territory, accompanied by the slow rousing of the Black Plateau in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Screed\">Screed</a>. The situation came to a head shortly after the Winter Solstice 381YE when the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushkan</a> army of the Iron Helms were <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/382YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Leviathan_Wakes_.28Spiral.29\" title=\"382YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">unleashed against the Grendel</a>. During the Battle of Solen's Doubt in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Apstrus\">Apstus</a>, three Grendel armies were permanently destroyed as a wave of madness swept through both Imperial and orc forces that culminated in the awakening of the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> - an event whose repercussions are still not entirely understood.</p><div style=\"float:right; width: 500px;\"><div class=\"box\"><div class=\"box-inner\"><b>The Plateau Ascendant</b><br /><p>Shortly before the Spring Equinox 382YE, the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> became active to a degree unprecedented in the history of the Empire. This has a number of effects, many of which are not yet clear. What is certain for the time being however is:</p><ul><li> Every army fighting in Spiral will take 25% additional casualties going forward</li><li> It is impossible to receive natural resupply in Spiral</li><li> Any army that sends the season in Spiral will lose 5% of its maximum fighting strength over the course of that season even if it is not engaged.</li><li> Fleets, military units, businesses, and farms have their production reduced by a quarter. The nightmares and the oppressive power of the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> encourages any living person in Spiral to leave. Only the completion of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#The_Block\">the Block</a> allows other personal resources to prosper, and creates safe havens for Urizen citizens to live here.</li><li> The mithril in the Legacy appears to shield the workers there somewhat, but there are few workers prepared to make the trip to Ossuary given the recent history of the mithril mine and the constant threat of the Black Plateau. As a consequence the upkeep of the Legacy has been doubled for the forseeable future.</li></ul>Over the last few years there have been several magical rituals designed to deal with the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span>. None of those rituals will have any effect, for good or ill, on the active Black Plateau. Indeed, it is highly unlikely that <i>any</i> ritual magic will be effective against the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> in its current roused state.</div></div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Features\">Major Features</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Black_Plateau\">The  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span></span></h3><p>A great plateau of volcanic glass with a dire reputation. Artefacts from the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> are often considered haunted or touched by malign evil, and are generally destroyed when they are encountered. Scholars have established that while many of the artefacts recovered from the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> date back to the days of distant Terunael, and to pre-Urizen Spiral, there are occasional artefacts that reach back even further - they cannot agree on the exact age of the plateau but the volcanic glass may date back to a period before human history.</p><p>Barbarians armed with weapons fashioned from the glass taken from the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> overran the defenders of Spiral, resisting all efforts to throw them back. There are no permanent settlements or spires in the area <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Screed\">around the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span></a> - attempts to establish them ended in tragedy without exception. Even the barbarians are not stupid enough to spend more time than they need to near the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span>. For the last three decades there have been stories of insane, bestial humans - presumably the children and grandchildren of Urizen left behind when Spiral fell to the barbarians - who live on and around the plateau. Their motivations, assuming they even exist, are unknown.</p><p>The plateau appears to feed on and amplify negative emotions - especially hate, rage, fear, and despair. Those fighting in the territory when it became active also reported hallucinations and oppressive, malign thoughts causing them to dwell on past failures, insults, and suspicions. In some cases these thoughts lead to tragic action. Shortly before the Spring Equinox 382YE, the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> was <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/382YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Leviathan_Wakes_.28Spiral.29\" title=\"382YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">roused to full wakefulness</a> with dire consequences.</p><p>Interestingly, it seems that those of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Cambion\" title=\"Cambion\">cambion</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Lineage\" title=\"Lineage\">lineage</a> are particularly resistant to this oppressive influence; they still experience the urges, thoughts, and visions but rather than giving in to them they tend to become stubborn, obdurate, uncooperative, and self-contained. This means that Urizen with cambion blood are very much in demand to serve as scouts and messengers between isolated spires not conencted to the Heliopticon- but the very quality that makes them so useful also means they tend to be frustratingly intractable and prone to embarking on unrelated side quests that they have decided are more important than the mission given them by their \"superiors\".</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Three_Passes\">The Three Passes</span></h3><p>Before the Autumn Equinox 381YE, the Grendel engaged in a program of collapsing the passes through the western and the northern mountains out of Spiral. At this time there are only three major passes still open that are large enough to allow a campaign army to pass through them without difficulty. </p><ul><li> The <b>Onyx Path</b> linking <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Optarion\" title=\"Redoubt\">Optarion</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Ateri\" title=\"Spiral\">Ateri</a>. The western end of the pass is guarded by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Court_of_the_White_Fountain\" title=\"Redoubt\">Court of the White Fountain</a>, while the eastern end emerges near the ruins of Fort Mezudan.</li><li> The <b>Crow Road</b> linking <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Willstone\" title=\"Redoubt\">Willstone</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Cinion\" title=\"Spiral\">Cinion</a>. The western end of the pass is watched by the resourceful sentinels of Willstone spire, while the eastern end emerges in the hills above the ruins of Damakan's Forge.</li><li> The <b>Twilight Gate</b> linking the plains of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Proceris\" title=\"Zenith\">Proceris</a> and the northern <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Ossuary\" title=\"Spiral\">Ossuary</a>. This \"pass\" is wide enough that it would be extremely difficult to close it without constructing a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a>.</li></ul><p>These three passes now effectively control access from Imperial territory into Spiral, and vice versa. There are several smaller, higher passes still intact of course that can be used by small groups or caravans - but these are not suitable for a campaign army to use.</p><p>Of particular note, the mountains of Apstrus contain no passes through to the Grendel territory of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bay_of_Catazar#Mareave\" title=\"Bay of Catazar\">Mareave</a> that are suitable for use by an Imperial army. Without an opportunity it is only possible to enter Mareave through Apulus.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ruins_of_Fort_Mezudan\">Ruins of Fort Mezudan</span></h3><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortress</a> Fort Mezudan - also known as the Fist - was under construction at the time the barbarians attack, but workers and guards refused the order to destroy the walls. When the original defences against the barbarians fell, the workers armed themselves and held the semi-completed fortress for two weeks until Imperial reinforcements arrived. For that reason the stone-crafters guild were always considered to have nominal control of this small fortress, and no decade went by without some major renovation or improvement being undertaken.</p><p>During Winter 377YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Master_of_Works\" title=\"Imperial Master of Works\">Imperial Master of Works</a> arranged for emergency supplies and many wains of white granite collected by Marcus of Endsmeet to reach the stone-crafters guild of Ateri. While Imperial forces occupied the invading orc armies, the final months of work were <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_Ateri_in_Spiral\" title=\"Fortify Ateri in Spiral\">completed</a> at a feverish rate that burnt out almost the entire ushabti work force. By the middle of Spring 378YE, the Fist was complete, ready to serve its intended purpose as a bastion for Imperial forces against the invaders of Spiral.</p><p>Unfortunately, shortly after the Autumn Equinox 379YE, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/379YE_Winter_Solstice_winds_of_war#The_Ruin_of_Fort_Mezudan\" title=\"379YE Winter Solstice winds of war\">powerful magical storm</a> struck the fortress, which had already been damaged as part of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/379YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#The_Siege_of_Fort_Mezudan\" title=\"379YE Autumn Equinox winds of war\">renewed Grendel offensive</a>. The Fist was completely destroyed.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ankarien\">Ankarien</span></h3><p>On the slopes of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Ankra\">Ankra</a> stood the Spire of Ankarien. One of the oldest and most prestigious of the Urizen spires, it was home to perhaps the finest library in the Empire. The infamous <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Emperor_Nicovar\" title=\"Emperor Nicovar\">Emperor Nicovar</a> was born here, and lived much of his early life at Ankarien; this did not spare the library from his destructive wrath as he descended into madness. What Nicovar did not quite achieve, the barbarians almost managed. As they drew near the librarians carried much of the contents to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Endsmeet\" title=\"Zenith\">Endsmeet</a>. The Spire itself now lies in ruins, and the remainder of its books and scrolls are presumed destroyed by the savage orcs.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Block\">The Block</span></h3><p>Not far from Damakhan's Forge in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Cinion\">Cinion</a> stands the Block, a vital construction that helps alleviate some of the impact of the <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span>. Proposed in Winter 382YE by a group of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_religious_beliefs#Illuminates\" title=\"Urizen religious beliefs\">illuminates</a>, <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_path_that_winds#The_Block\" title=\"The path that winds\">the Block</a> is positioned within a circle of blasted and burnt trees that seems to be a powerful locus of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Winter_magic\" title=\"Winter magic\">Winter magic</a>.</p><p>Following their suggestions, the Imperial Senate <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Construct_Mithril_Block\" title=\"Construct Mithril Block\">approved construction</a> of a carefully shaped block of mithril, aligned with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Oak\" title=\"The Oak\">Oak</a> an the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Key_and_The_Lock#The_Lock\" title=\"The Key and The Lock\">Lock</a> and used to harness the power of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> that lies at the heart of the blasted grove. The block now emanates waves of magic across the territory following the old heliopticon paths. While it is in no way powerful enough to impact the emanations of the <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span>, any spire built in the territory with the correct web of mithril nodes is able to focus that energy and protect the inhabitants of the spire from the worst of the Plateau's influence. The protection offered by the block means that people can live in Spiral despite the curse of the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span>, allowing for a slight increase in the rate of recovery for the territory and its contributions to Imperial coffers.</p><p>Unfortunately the power of the block is not sufficient to deal with all the problems encountered by those <i>outside</i> the warded spires. The penalties to armies, in particular, and the increased upkeep of the Legacy, are not affected. Likewise, the wilderness outside the Spires continues to be extremely dangerous.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Legacy\">The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Legacy\" title=\"Legacy\">Legacy</a></span></h3><p>This vast mine complex is mostly played out today, but still manages to produces significant quantities of mithril for whoever controls it. According to legend the site was part of a great gift to the Urizen people but who gave it to them, and why, are details lost to time.</p><p>The Legacy is a national <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Bourse#The_Legacy\" title=\"Bourse\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Bourse position</a> which produces mithril. Control of the Legacy is assigned to whichever Urizen candidate receives the most support from Urizen owners of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mana_site\" title=\"Mana site\">mana sites</a>. This Bourse position produces 22 Imperial wains of mithril every season.</p><p>This Bourse seat has changed hands numerous times. As of Autumn 383YE it is in the hands of barbarian orcs.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Extreme_Gardening.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Extreme Gardening.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f5/Extreme_Gardening.jpg/400px-Extreme_Gardening.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f5/Extreme_Gardening.jpg/600px-Extreme_Gardening.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/thumb/f/f5/Extreme_Gardening.jpg/800px-Extreme_Gardening.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">Spiral is an ancient battlefield.</div></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ankra\">Ankra</span></h3><p><b>Quality:</b> Hills<br />The mountains of Ankra are the site of some of the oldest spires in Urizen, including one of the most prestigious - the library of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#Ankarien\">Ankarien</a>.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Apstrus\">Apstrus</span></h3><p>The lower slopes of the Apstrus peaks are covered in rolling woodland, carefully cultivated by ushabti and at one time produced a great bounty of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Forest\" title=\"Forest\">forest</a> materials, especially <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Iridescent_Gloaming\" title=\"Materials\">Iridescent Gloaming</a>. The <i>dreaming spires of Apsterus</i> (as they were often known) were dedicated to philosophical thought, their forest-bounty providing the inhabitants with lives of comfort despite their location on the very eastern edge of the Empire. One of the most prestigious was <b>Solen's Doubt</b>. Dedicated to experimental philosophy, it was a place for solitary study and thought. Unsurprisingly, it was overrun during the barbarian march to conquer the territory. The Battle of Solen's Doubt shortly before the Spring Equinox 382YE saw Imperial and Grendel forces clash here for the final time during the campaign. Three Grendel armies disbanded due to the presence of the Iron Helms, and the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span> became fully active. Five hundred Imperials died in the very instant the plateau awoke; both forces withdrew in disarray in the wake of the calamity.</p><p>Of special interest to the Urizen, the central <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_culture_and_customs#The_Heliopticon\" title=\"Urizen culture and customs\">Heliopticon</a> tower for Spiral stood on the northern slopes of Apstrus, the heart of the communication network. The defenders held the tower for several months against the barbarians, allowing the rest of Spiral additional warning of army movements, and relaying desperate messages for aid to Morrow and Redoubt. When the tower finally fell, it is assumed the barbarians either destroyed the specially calibrated mirror and the light-source (a glowing stone infused with the magic of the Realm of Day), or stole them away. Some recent rumours suggest these two components might have been hidden by the defenders, and only uncovered recently, but the facts are unclear - and idle speculation has no place in the study of history.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Apulus\">Apulus</span></h3><p><b>Qualities:</b> Coastal, Ruins<br />Before it was taken by the barbarians, Apulus was the gateway to adventure for the people of Urizen and, to a degree, the Empire. Expeditions into the wilds outside the borders would rest here before undertaking their quests into the unknown wilderness. Ships from across the Bay of Catazar docked at the coastal spires here, with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">League</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Brass_Coast\" title=\"The Brass Coast\">Freeborn</a> adventurers in particular being regular visitors. </p><p>Perhaps the worst casualty of the barbarian invasion was the <b>Lighthouse at Apulian</b>, a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Great_work\" title=\"Great work\">Great work</a> that served as both a spire dedicated to foreign trade and a beacon for all the Urizen fleets based in Spiral. The last Keeper of the Lighthouse, Hadrian of Apulian, burst the entire structure apart once it became clear it would fall to the orcs, shattering the magical stone (a gift from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eternal\" title=\"Eternal\">eternal</a> <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kimus\" title=\"Kimus\">Kimus</a>) that served as the light. The white granite tower exploded in a thunderous detonation, the echoes of which were reportedly heard as far away as <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos\" title=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</a> and the island of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Madruga#The_Lyceum\" title=\"Madruga\">Lyceum</a>. The release of magical power incinerated several hundred orcs, along with all the defenders of Apulian. Some refugees from Spiral attempted to have Hadrian declared an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Paragons_and_Exemplars#Exemplars\" title=\"Paragons and Exemplars\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Exemplar</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Loyalty\" title=\"Loyalty\">Loyalty</a>, but received little support from the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Imperial Synod</a>.

Then in 380YE, during a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Tree_of_ice_(conjunction)\" title=\"Tree of ice (conjunction)\">conjunction of the fountain</a>, powerful ritual magic sank the entire coastline of Apulus into the Bay, transforming the region into a stinking mire.

The Onyx Path is one of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#The_Three_Passes\">three passes</a> wide enough to allow an <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_army\" title=\"Imperial army\">Imperial army</a> to move between Spiral and the rest of the Empire.

Until <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Beware_my_power#The_Rejuvenation_of_Cinion\" title=\"Beware my power\">Winter 380YE</a> the region was littered with ruined spires, most long since looted by the barbarians. Several of these spires stood over plentiful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a> and there were many rich veins of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Tempest_Jade\" title=\"Materials\">tempest jade</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Weltsilver\" title=\"Materials\">weltsilver</a>. The mines remain, but almost all the ruined spires are now gone. Those that survived the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/380YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Fire_on_the_Mountains\" title=\"380YE Spring Equinox winds of war\">supernatural fires that raged across the mountains</a> in Spring 380YE were consumed by trees and vegetation invoked with powerful Spring magic designed to rejuvenate the area.</p><p>One small area proved resistant to the magic released to heal the wounded hills. A grove of blasted and burnt trees, no more than twenty-feet across, remains devoid of greenery to this day. Magicians who have visited the area suggest that it is infused with the power of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Winter_magic\" title=\"Winter magic\">Winter magic</a> and that it forms the locus of a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> tied to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Thrice-cursed_Court\" title=\"The Thrice-cursed Court\">Thrice-cursed Court</a>. A small group of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_magical_traditions#Illuminates\" title=\"Urizen magical traditions\">illuminates</a> have committed to keeping an eye on the place; their suggestion in Winter 382YE lead to the creation of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#The_Block\">the Block</a> that now occupies the blasted grove and provides magical protection to the spires of Spiral against the influence of the  <span style=\"color:#2F4F4F; background:#D3D3D3\">Black Plateau</span>.</p><p>The most famous of the lost spires was probably <b>Damakan\u2019s Forge</b> - and alone of the old spires, it still stands reasonably hale and healthy despite damage from the magical flames and the uncontrollable Spring magic. Damakan was renowned as the greatest Urizen swordsmith of antiquity, and even today her blades change hands for small fortunes. Although many of her secrets went with her to her grave, a small lodge of smiths have maintained her forge and traditions in its original site in the Spiral. Crafters who were allowed to work with this lodge are rare indeed, but those few who did were able to create swords of surpassing excellence. The spire fell to the barbarians forty years ago - it is unclear how many of the secrets of the weaponsmiths fell into their hands at this time. The smaller settlement of <b>Ossen's Spire</b> served as a gateway to Damakan\u2019s Forge, where those who wished to serve there came here first, and those who wished a sword from there lived at Ossen's Spire to prove their worth before being granted the honour. Unfortunately, the spire was completely consumed in the fires raised during the liberation of Spiral.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#The_Three_Passes\">Crow Road</a> is one of the three passes that connect Spiral to the Empire, linking Cinion with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt#Willstone\" title=\"Redoubt\">Willstone</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Redoubt\" title=\"Redoubt\">Redoubt</a>. The eastern end of the pass is watched by the resourceful sentinels of Willstone spire, while the eastern end emerges in the hills above the ruins of Damakhan's Forge.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ossuary\">Ossuary</span></h3><p>Ossuary takes its name from the large number of giant bones regularly unearthed in the mines here. Scholars are at a loss to explain them - some claim they may be the bones of great <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mundane_beasts#Drakes\" title=\"Mundane beasts\">drakes</a> or perhaps even <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Legendary_beasts#Dragons.2C_Wyverns_and_Wyrms\" title=\"Legendary beasts\">dragons</a>. Many of these bones have been exported to other parts of the Empire where they are studied or presented as curiosities. </p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#The_Legacy\">Legacy</a> is in Ossuary; a vital resource that provided mithril to the people of Urizen, which was primarily used to enhance mana sites. It was lost to the Grendel in Summer 379YE, causing a significant blow to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Prosperity\" title=\"Prosperity\">prosperity</a> of Urizen - and potentially to their ability to work magic.</p><p>From northern Ossuary, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Spiral#The_Three_Passes\">Twilight Gate</a> connects Spiral to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith#Proceris\" title=\"Zenith\">Proceris</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Zenith\" title=\"Zenith\">Zenith</a>.

Even when the territory was in Imperial hands, Screed was largely deserted apart from temporary camps of scholars studying the plateau and its artefacts. Today, the barbarians are said to be employing scavenging teams - some supplemented with human slaves - here, but likewise have avoided creating any permanent settlements.</p><div style=\"float: right; width=300px; margin-right:10px; margin-left: 10px; clear: right;\"><table><tr><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Summit</th><th style=\"background-color: LightBlue;\">Elected</th></tr><tr><td>Spring Equinox 383YE</td><td>Maximillian</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn Equinox 382YE</td><td>Maximillian</td></tr><tr><td>Spring Equinox 382YE</td><td>Tanwyn Ankarien</td></tr><tr><td>Summer Solstice 380YE</td><td>Tanwyn Ankarien</td></tr></table></div><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_Senate_Elections\">Recent Senate Elections</span></h2><p>As an Imperial territory, Spiral was represented by a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> elected in the Spring.
