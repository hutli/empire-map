Summer is short, but Winter is long, and haunted by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sermersuaq#Northern_lights\" title=\"Sermersuaq\">eerie lights</a> in the sky. Gildenheim in the east was once the second largest settlement in Wintermark. The territory was once an important part of Wintermark; the folk of Skarsind were particularly noted for their fine rune work and many of the best <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Crafting_skills#Artisan\" title=\"Crafting skills\">artisans</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Wintermark_magical_traditions#Runesmiths\" title=\"Wintermark magical traditions\">runesmiths</a> travelled here to study their craft.</p><p>Now, the people of Skarsind are the Imperial Orcs.

The Imperial Orcs do nothing to make them unwelcome, but for many there is simply nothing left for them in Skarsind.

The forests and tundra of this territory are rich with animal life that sustains the Winterfolk, ranging from great furred beasts to small game and hunting birds. The northern waters are home to seals and penguins, and full of fish and whales. As one travels further north, the land becomes colder and colder until a traveller comes to transient ice floes that mark the farthest extent of the land claimed by the Winterfolk. This fertile territory is under constant threat from both the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Thule\" title=\"Thule\">Thule</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Jotun\" title=\"Jotun\">Jotun</a> whose hunting parties also seek to exploit the profusion of life here, regularly engaging in skirmishes with the Winterfolk who live here.</p><p>Sermersuaq is notable for the interconnected freshwater lakes of Lansipari, Ittanpari, Atkonaroq, Sarda, Rikkivesi and the Eastern Floes. Deep and frigid, often dotted with chunks of floating ice in the coldest winters, perhaps half the area of Sermersuaq is made up of these frigid \"inland seas.\" these massive waterways teem with fish and are said to be connected to each other by flooded underground passages and the lakes on <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Kallavesa\" title=\"Kallavesa\">Kallavesa</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Hahnmark\" title=\"Hahnmark\">Hahnmark</a>. Old stories speak of the lakes being \"<i>carved by mountains</i>\" in some fashion. There are many halls built along the shores of the lake who prosper through fishing and occasionally trading across the cool waters.</p><p>Beyond the ice floes is the wasteland of Tsirku, where the ground is permanently covered in snow. The landscape is far from flat, there are ice plateaus pock-marked with crevasses and areas where the ice is rent apart giving way to cold salty lakes. Here rages the eternal ice-storm Sydanjaa, a roaring blizzard that blows all year round and from whose depths no traveller has ever returned.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">Senator</a> for Sermersuaq is appointed by the Suaq during the Summer solstice, and is almost invariably from Suaq stock.</p><h2>",

        "description": "</h2><p>Miaren is a land of gentle golden woodlands, open steadings, fertile fields, fair winds and the great Navarr city of Seren. It lies on the border between Dawn and the Marches, between Wintermark and the League. </p><p>In the early years of the Empire the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Vallorn\" title=\"Vallorn\">vallorn</a> at Miaren was completely destroyed and at the heart of the forest the ruins of the city Seren reclaimed, to be slowly rebuilt. It is now considered the heartland of the Navarr nation, and a symbol of what can be achieved.</p><p>Today Miaren is dotted with carefully tended woodlands, farms, and orchards; only in the north-western region of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren#Goldglades\">Goldglades</a> is there any true forest. With so much open ground to work with, many of Miaren's <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steading\" title=\"Steading\">steadings</a> have expanded in size far beyond the settlements encountered in other Navarr territories. They increasingly have more in common with the towns and villages of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawn</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Marches\" title=\"Marches\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Marches</a> than with the steadings of other territories.

The city of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Miaren#Seren\">Seren</a> is well-known as being built among the ruins of the former Terunael city, but the Navarr are careful not to damage <i>any</i> ruins they have found that have withstood the malice of the vallorn. Any farm might have a carefully preserved ruined tower, any orchard might be bounded by a high wall of unfamiliar construction, any well might be surrounded by wind-worn statues from a time long before the Empire. To those not acquainted with the practice, this can give the territory a slightly eerie quality despite its otherwise pastoral beauty.</p><p>Miaren sees a lot of trade - again its central location combines with its proximity to the heartlands of the Empire to see regular merchant caravans from most Imperial nations. It produces a significant amount of the vinum sap used to create <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Liao\" title=\"Liao\">liao</a> for example - more than any other territory in the Empire.

The vales here exist among rich forests, where they have not been cleared to make way for small farms. Karov has the largest towns in Varushka, and the majority of its boyars come from this relatively civilised territory. A great deal of trade happens in Karov, with wagon trains and river barges carrying raw materials south to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Temeschwar\" title=\"Temeschwar\">Temeschwar</a> or <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Weirwater\" title=\"Weirwater\">Weirwater</a> and north to more isolated valleys who are in need. </p><p>Despite its settled nature, it would be a mistake to think the land is entirely tamed and great tracts of wilderness still remain, often home to particularly malignant \u2013 if quiescent \u2013 <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushkan_Monsters\" title=\"Varushkan Monsters\" class=\"mw-redirect\">sovereigns</a>.

They ruthlessly cleared areas of forests to build their settlements and some of the oldest towns show clear influence of their shared heritage with the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Steinr\" title=\"Steinr\">Steinr</a> of Wintermark, especially in the west. Indeed, there are several old battlefields in western Karov where Vard and Steinr, and later Varushkan and Wintermark, clashed in the distant past long before the foundation of the Empire. A number of very old tales from Karov include two siblings who romance a stranger; the former represent Vard and Steinr, the latter the Ushka. Invariably the elder sibling wins the affection of the stranger, and the younger angrily retreats to the west. This is a highly stylised and historically dubious version of the founding of Varushka, but it is popular nonetheless.</p><p>On the whole, the folk of Karov enjoy many of the finer things in life - good food, good drink and regular festivals. Many towns and villages in Karov employ <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Stzena\" title=\"Stzena\">Stzena</a>, local musicians who perform at local civic events and celebrations; there are several vales here dedicated specifically to the training of Stzena, and recording and preserving the music and songs of the Varushkan people.-</p><h2>",

An obvious alternative for increasing the prosperity of the territory would be to construct a port in Bittershore, now that the Sand Fishers have relocated, allowing for trade with Dawn and the western territories of Varushka.</p><p>In addition to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Crawling_Depths\" title=\"Crawling Depths\">Crawling Depths</a> and the Silent Pines, the territory is actually remarkably rich in raw materials. The forests are full of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Beggar.27s_Lye\" title=\"Materials\">beggarwood</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Ambergelt\" title=\"Materials\">ambergelt</a>, with extensive deposits of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Materials#Dragonbone\" title=\"Materials\">dragonbone</a> reported in the Drownbark Forest. The Galath Fields and the inland portions of Bittershore are composed of rich, fertile soil that is already producing fine harvests for Varushkan settlers. There are almost no <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mine\" title=\"Mine\">mines</a> in the territory, however, and it seems the best locations for establishing mana sites are buried in the depths of the forests in out-of-the-way areas that in some cases are still controlled by orc bandits.</p><h2>",

Since the end of the Highborn civil war, Bastion has presented the calm, serene visage of the Highborn to the world. During the founding of the Empire, Bastion very nearly became the \"official\" capital of the Empire in 3YE; at the last minute the Senate decided to hold their quarterly gatherings in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Casinea#Anvil\" title=\"Casinea\">Anvil</a> instead.</p><p>It was settled in the first years after <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard_history#The_founding\" title=\"Highguard history\">the founding</a>; but the focus of the early years remained on the southern territory of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Necropolis#Pharos\" title=\"Necropolis\">Pharos</a>. Considered a hinterland where a military presence was necessary rather than a place to settle, Bastion remained sparsely populated for decades; most settlements were little more than small fortifications along the northern and eastern borders. Things began to change as the first ripples of the Revelation began to shake Highborn society. As the patricians became more and more embroiled in their personal feuds and agendas, the Highborn who would become the founders of the Revelation sought fresh opportunities in Bastion.</p><p>The civil war swept across Bastion as well as Pharos, and several chapters were destroyed in the fighting. Several have never been restored, left as reminders of the follies of the past and a warning to the future. Once the war was over, however, the new Assembly of the Virtuous constructed a new city along the banks of the Couros, seeking a new start for their people and their nation.</p><h2>",

        "description": "</h2><p>Necropolis is a land of sorrow, first and foremost. Poets wax lyrical about the sad grandeur of the landscape, but even the least sensitive sometimes have to suppress a cold realisation of their own mortality. Yet the sorrow of Necropolis is tempered with the knowledge that <i>all</i> things pass - that sorrows teach valuable lessons, and that loss is part of life. Even the most bustling chapterhouse in Necropolis will contain some <i>memento mori</i>, some little touch that is ignored consciously but that subconsciously reminds them every day that people die. </p><p>The first Highborn settled along the coast of the Bay of Catazar here, and some of the oldest post-Terunael human-built structures are found here. In some ways, it is the foundation upon which Highguard - and to a degree the Empire - was built.</p><p>When the Highborn arrived, the entire area that is now Highguard was controlled by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Orc\" title=\"Orc\">orcs</a>. As they established themselves, the newly arrived humans drove the orcs north and east - eventually eliminating the majority of the orc nations and forcing the rest to flee toward <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos\" title=\"Reikos\">Reikos</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Mallum\" title=\"The Mallum\">the Mallum</a>.

The city of Pharos was burnt to the ground during the time of turmoil, the civil war between the patricians and the chapters. Yet Pharos was not the only victim of the war - a number of towns and early chapters were destroyed by one side or the other. Many were never rebuilt, serving as permanent memorials to, and warnings against, the most tragic period in the history of Highguard.

Second, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Reikos#Gardens_of_Chalcis\">Gardens of Chalcis</a> produced herbs sold all over the Empire.

        "description": "</h2><p>Peering at each other across the fast-flowing Vassa, Tassato is called the Twin City or the Split City. Providing the only easy way to cross the wide and dangerous river, Tassato is a city divided against itself. Tassato was originally two towns, Mestra and Regario, allegedly named for the feuding <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Highguard\" title=\"Highguard\">Highborn</a> siblings who historically <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League_history#Origins_of_the_League\" title=\"The League history\">founded</a> them on either bank of the Vassa. Over time, both towns grew on each bank and the river formed a natural boundary between them. Attempts to build bridges between the cities have always foundered and the people rely on boats and barges to cross the river. Along with <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Sarvos\" title=\"Sarvos\">Sarvos</a>, they quietly seceded from Highguard during that nations' civil war, uniting with their cousins to the south to resist all attempts to bring them back under the Highborn banner.</p><p>The western part of the city is called Tassato Mestra, and the eastern is Tassato Regario. The people on either side of the river are historically rivals, and that historical rivalry occasionally boils up into open conflict. The two cities were unified under the control of Anabela di Regario, a merchant prince who ruled over a century before the creation of the Empire. Anabela was forced to contend with the constant rivalry between the two cities- open battles in the streets between bravos were causing widespread lawlessness and in the end the prince declared a ban on the open carrying of weapons. The ban had the desired effect, damping down the bloodshed although and the rivalry was slowly transformed to verbal banter between the two sides. The ban endured until Tassato joined the Empire and in that time the people became famous for their wordplay, launching quips and insults at each other like arrows.</p><p>Citizens of Tassato generally refer to Regario and Mestra as separate places, while everyone else refers to them as wards or parts of the same city.Today Tassato enjoys an unrivalled reputation as a city where the spoken word is an art-form. Tassatans take a delight in layered meanings, subtexts and unspoken communication. The city has provided several senators famous for their brilliant oratory and representatives from the city are usually regarded as the finest diplomats in the Empire. Of all the people of the League, Tassatans are most likely to view life as a game and they are notorious for their love of intrigue, not just for the sake of advancement but for the sheer pleasure to be had thereby. They regard cunning diplomacy more highly than armed conflict, not because they are peace-loving, but instead because they regard words as a more effective tool than weapons in destroying their enemies - better to set enemies against enemies than to face them yourself. Manipulation is high art here - no surprise that some of the finest <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Mountebanks\" title=\"Mountebanks\" class=\"mw-redirect\">mountebanks</a> hail from Tassato.</p><p>Tassato chooses a <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senator</a> each Autumn equinox, and as might be imagined the election is often bitterly contested. Traditionally, being senator for Tassato is regarded as one of the worst seats in the Imperial Senate. If the senator is from the city itself, then they often encounter resistance and hostility from the folk from the other side of the river. If they are not from the city proper - if they refuse to pick a side - they are generally treated as interlopers and encounter harassment from citizens from both sides of the river. A few wealthy guilds that live outside the city proper maintain a discreet distance from the intrigues of their more urban cousins - the votes of these guilds are much sought after by candidates regardless of where they live.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Bold_Tassatan.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Bold Tassatan.png\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png/500px-Bold_Tassatan.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/a/a0/Bold_Tassatan.png 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">Tassato is home to bold bravos, master merchants, divine dramaturges and princes of the League.</div></div><h2>",

It sees itself as the cultural centre of the League, and arguably the whole Empire. It takes its common epithet from the many mirrors found upon the roofs of the city, said to \"sparkle like gems\" during the day. Folk legend suggests that if the mirrors are shattered the city will surely fall, and for this reason some citizens carry a mirror about their person, an affectation that encourages unfair accusations of vanity.</p><p>Sarvos is as driven as any city in the League, but art is its true passion. They claim to have invented theatre, a ludicrous claim but believable in a city graced with so many theatre-houses. They are certainly the originators of the magician <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Troupes\" title=\"Troupes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">troupes</a> that are now commonplace throughout the League and they are usually the centre of League performance magic. Not just theatre is popular however; there are rival opera houses whose bitter divisions are every bit as keen as those of the leading theatre troupes. Several wealthy merchant princes have endowed their collections of art on the city and there are public galleries where the most beautiful pictures and sculptures can be viewed in exchange for a ring or two. </p><p>The land around the Bay of Catazar is lush and fertile, with low flood-plains; olive farms and prime grazing lands fed by the waters of four rivers: the lazy Couros that flows along the border of Highguard and Urizen; the flighty Scorrero, whose capricious nature has drowned many an unwary river captain on its course through the Brass Coast; the broad-banked Gancio, solid and well-defended; and the furious Vassa that flows down through Tassato.  The four rivers are central characters in the art and folklore of the city. All the classic literature and theatre includes them in one form or another, whether as central characters or \u201cclowns\u201d during the interludes. A popular game between playwrights and critics is to conceal the characters in some way and challenge the critic to locate them. </p><h2>",

Citizens of Temeschwar commonly make an effort to be as flamboyant as their southern fellows, but their dress is inevitably more practical, to accommodate the harsh northern weather. They are traditionally more brutally pragmatic than those who live on the bay. It is a foothold of trade to Varushka, Wintermark and nearby Dawn. Trading in raw materials and crafted goods, especially weapons and armour, it is seen by many as the merchant capital of the northern lands.</p><p>Despite its good relations with Varushka, Temeschwar has always suffered somewhat from being distant from Sarvos and Tassato whose close proximity made them the natural heart of the League. Temeschwar may well be the richest of all the cities of the League, but it can never quite shake the fear that it is not as good as the others.  This anxiety is just part of what drives the Temeschwari to be so competitive and so ruthless. Temeschwari strive to work that bit longer and that bit harder than anyone else in the League. If a Sarvossian closes their shop at sunset, their Temeschwari neighbour will light a pair of lanterns and keep trading for another hour.</p><p>Not all relations with Varushka are good, however. There is still some bad blood between those of old Varushkan stock in Temeschwar and the citizens of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karov#Delev\" title=\"Karov\">Delev</a> in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karov\" title=\"Karov\">Karov</a>. When Temeschwar joined the Empire it attempted to prove that it had legitimate ownership of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Karov#The_Eternal_Shafts_of_Time\" title=\"Karov\">Eternal Shafts of Time</a>, a rich mithril mine on the border between the two territories. There are still plays and theatrical adaptations that revolve around the underhand, ruthless way the boyar of Delev \"stole\" the mine from under the noses of the Temeschwari, and relations between some Delev traders and and some citizens of Temeschwar are chilly to this day - especially in the rare cases where there is some distant blood connection between the two.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Isabella de la Torre, of the Brotherhood of the Ashen Tower.\"><img alt=\"Isabella de la Torre, of the Brotherhood of the Ashen Tower.\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/d3/TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg/300px-TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/d/d3/TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg/450px-TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/d/d3/TemeschwariDraugir2.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">They wear their reputation for cold, hard dealing with pride.</div></div><p>The Temeschwari are not just the most competitive people in the League, they also have a well deserved reputation as the most ruthless. In the years before the creation of the Empire, the city was plagued by gangs of thieves and assassins who operated with open impunity despite the best efforts of the boyar, Ratibor. Thousands of inhabitants were linked with the different gangs who used tattoos to mark membership and enforce loyalty.</p><p>In the end Ratibor hired a force of Varushkan mercenaries and brought them in secret into the city during the depths of winter. In the notorious night of a thousand torches (named for the torches the soldiers carried to light their way) every inhabitant of the city was turned out of their beds, stripped and searched for marks. Anyone with a tattoo on their body was given a few minutes to collect their belongings before being forced from the city into the frozen snows beyond the walls. A few managed to bribe their way past the search but most were given over to the winter and were never seen again. The act was one of monstrous brutality, but it established the power of Ratibor as boyar and broke the power of the criminal gangs forever.</p><p>The Temeschwari wear their reputation for cold, hard dealing with pride. They view themselves as the strongest people in the League, combining the ambition and drive of the south with the strength and determination of the north. Physical as well as mental strength is prized here - Temeschwari bravos are as likely to favour the axe as the rapier - and her free companies have a reputation for toughness, as soldiers and as people. Most Temeschwari free companies are careful not to break the rules for they know the magistrates watch them carefully - but they will do almost anything required to win short of this. You can find many things in Temeschwar, it is said, but you will not find a scruple though you search the city from sunrise to sunset.</p><h2>",

For the most part, however, the buffer provided by the Lasambrian Hills to the south and west meant that foreign armies rarely had the stomach for protracted campaigns. For most of the last two centuries, Segura was a centre of trade rather than conflict. The Freeborn prospered in the certain knowledge that their way of life was secure ... until the barbarians of the Lasambrian Hills put aside their differences and sent a great army sweeping down to burn and pillage the plains of Segura.</p><h2>",

Large open buildings, with doorways and halls just larger than a human might need, they create a sense of open space that has set the pattern for all Urizen architecture.</p><p>Despite its great age Morrow moves inexorably forward, and many of its spires are undergoing constant reconstruction and improvement. It is said that \u201cno two days find the same Morrow\u201d as the Urizen constantly strive to perfect their land even further. A project may take a decade or even more to come to fruition, but the Urizen pride themselves on vision and their desire to perfect their world.</p><h2>",

The result of some magical working? To date, no convincing explanation has been offered, and philosophers on all sides argue heatedly about their provenance.</p><p>Redoubt is lightly settled, even for Urizen, with many of the more prosperous spires being built along the coast, or overlooking the banks of the Couros river to the west. Unsurprisingly, there are many <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Urizen_military_concerns\" title=\"Urizen military concerns\">citadels</a> here and a strong martial tradition, but this is also a territory that produces more than its fair share of zoologists and botanists.
