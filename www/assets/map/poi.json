While the place itself is ordinary, four times each year it hosts the quarterly summits that chart the course the Empire travels through history. In the fields near the town, each of the ten nations of the Empire gather to establish national camps with the assistance of the civil service.</p><p>Everyone camps by nation at each summit - it is a matter of some pride for most nations to make the camp as welcoming as possible. In addition to sleeping and hosting tents, the nation camps contain any number of businesses, trading posts, and areas that reflect the unique nature of their nation such as the theatre in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_League\" title=\"The League\">the League</a> camp or the Glory square that forms the heart of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Dawn\" title=\"Dawn\">Dawnish</a> camp.</p><p>Between the nation camps stand a cluster of buildings and tents that, while humble in appearance, amount to the heart of the Empire. Camping here is carefully controlled by the civil service as the small amount of space between the historic buildings - the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Anvil#The_Senate\">Senate chamber</a> and <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Anvil#The_Forge\">the Forge</a> - is mostly reserved for the institutions that govern the Empire.</p><p>Although there is no formal or geographical distinction, the business of Anvil is most easily split into three primary areas - political, cultural, and magical.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Political\">Political</span></h2><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Senate_Chamber\">The Senate Chamber</span></h3><p>One of the few solid buildings in Anvil, the Senate is a sturdy structure where the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Senator\" title=\"Senator\">senators</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> meet during the quarterly summits to discuss the direction the Empire will take.

There is also a witness gallery, initially intended for the use of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Synod</a> priests to observe the business of the Senate, but today open to anyone who wishes to watch their senators debate the business of the day.</p><p>There is only one entrance to the Senate proper. While the Senate is meeting, this entrance is guarded by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Captain_of_the_Senate_Guard\" title=\"Captain of the Senate Guard\">Captain of the Senate Guard</a> and their hand-picked recruits. They carefully enforce the rules prohibiting entry to anyone who is not entitled to be on the floor during a Senate session.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the Senate Chamber is also home to the various auctions conducted by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Bourse\" title=\"Imperial Bourse\">Imperial Bourse</a>. Unlike a Senate session, these auctions are open to anyone, though the best prizes usually go to those with the heaviest purse.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Military_Council_Meeting.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Military Council Meeting.png\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/2/2f/Military_Council_Meeting.png/600px-Military_Council_Meeting.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"247\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/2/2f/Military_Council_Meeting.png 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/2/2f/Military_Council_Meeting.png 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\">The chamber where the Military Council meets.</div></div><p>The rest of the time, the Senate is available for use by private citizens and is a regular venue for concerts, plays, and debates.

The civil servants on duty here are available to answer queries or offer advice to concerned citizens, and messages can be left here for the attention of specific civil servants. The structure itself, a large white marquee, is deliberately fluid and expands or contracts over time based on the needs of the citizenry and the available resources.</p><p>It is here that <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Judgement\" title=\"Judgement\">judgements</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Synod\" title=\"Imperial Synod\">Imperial Synod</a> are presented, voted on, and resolved. Every judgement that has been submitted for consideration by the Synod is pinned to the walls of the Hub so that priests who visit can read and judge them accordingly.

This powerful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Regio\" title=\"Regio\">regio</a> is a site of great magical power, unique in the Empire (and perhaps even the world) in that it is connected to all six realms of magic. It is freely available to any ritual magician who wishes to draw on the power of the regio to strengthen their rituals. It is marked out by a wide circle of black monoliths.</p><p>Some historians believe it was the presence of this regio, more than the important role played by <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Anvil#The_Forge\">the Forge</a>, that caused the founders to make Anvil the heart of the Empire. The Imperial Regio enhances rituals performed within it, and can also be used to cast powerful magic that affects an entire <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Territory\" title=\"Territory\">territory</a> anywhere in the Empire. This allows Imperial magicians to perform rituals from Anvil that would otherwise require them to be in a regio situated in the target territory. As a result, during the summits, the Imperial Regio understandably can be extremely busy.</p><p>The regio also provides entrance to the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Anvil#Hall_of_the_Worlds\">Hall of the Worlds</a> - the magical space beyond the mundane world where the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Conclave\" title=\"Imperial Conclave\">Imperial Conclave</a> meets during the quarterly summits.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Hall_of_the_Worlds\">The Hall of the Worlds</span></h3><p>Technically, the Hall of the Worlds is not actually <i>in</i> Anvil.

This portal allows heralds in the service to the powerful <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Eternal\" title=\"Eternal\">eternals</a> to reach the Hall, and sometimes to pass through it to Anvil. Although it is impossible for a mortal to travel to one of the realms and survive, the portal is sometimes used by Imperial citizens to attend audiences with eternals or their servants in chambers that, like the Hall of the Worlds, somehow lie between the mortal world and each of the six realms.</p><p>Although the gate allows travel to and from other chambers - it does not permit a herald or similar creature to listen in on business taking place in the Conclave. All experimentation has repeatedly demonstrated that the only way for an inhabitant of the realms to hear what is said in Conclave is to physically enter the Hall of Worlds.

The arch itself stands a short distance from the heart of Anvil, giving ample space for armies of Imperial heroes to muster before passing through to face the enemies of the Empire.</p><p>Characters intending to take the battlefield in support of the Empire must muster before the gate when the time is ready. Likewise any character seeking to take advantage of the gate's magic to partake in a quest or skirmish will begin their journey at the Gate. Punctuality is essential - the gate operates to a rigid time-scale - once a doorway to a destination closes it cannot be reopened.</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Outer_Anvil\">Outer Anvil</span></h2><p>Outside the fields surrounding the Forge and the Senate Chamber there is a bustling village that serves to provide support to the people attending the Anvil summits. There are a large number of inns that offer reasonably priced rooms, eating and drinking establishments, and more. This cluster of buildings includes the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Custodian_of_the_Imperial_War_Memorial\" title=\"Custodian of the Imperial War Memorial\">Imperial War Memorial</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Long_Tom_Goodfellow#Long_Tom.27s_Brewery\" title=\"Long Tom Goodfellow\">Distillery of Tom Goodfellow</a> among others.</p><p><b>OOC Note:</b> \"Outer Anvil\" refers to the parts of the village that don't appear on the field. They serve to explain where people sleeping in their out-of-character sleeping tents are spending their nights, and where people are going in-character when they drop out-of-character to visit the caterers off the in-character field. Very occasionally Profound Decisions may create a quest or meeting that takes place in the \"outer Anvil\" area in a meeting room somewhere off the main field.</p><p>For more guidance on in- and

Local legend claims that there are thirteen stones in the Rushring, but accounts differ wildly, in some cases claiming there are as many as thirty-nine. There are likewise many stories about what the circle represents. Some claim it is a band of Jotun orcs turned to stone by a canny landskeeper, while others claim the stones mark the site of some terrible crime or ancient magical accident, perhaps that associated with the formation of the dead meres themselves.</p><div class=\"box\"><div class=\"box-inner\"><b>Rum beasts</b><br /><p>The Marches are not <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Varushka\" title=\"Varushka\">Varushka</a>, but that is not to say that it is a nation devoid of magical threats.

How real these creatures are is hard to say for certain. Western Bregas swear that the fens are home to eerie nocturnal ebon hounds that spell disaster for anyone who looks at them too closely. Wherever there is deep water, hungry bogs, or shifting paths there are stories of floating lights that lead travelers astray which are said to be the hateful spectres of men and women who drowned alone in the swamps.There are said to be certain trees that hate humans, and kill lone travellers with magical lures and strangling roots. Some of the people allegedly falling prey to these threats are likely the victims of Feni, or bandits, or their own poor luck traversing trackless marsh. Yet there are dangerous mundane creatures as well - the most common natural threat to Bregas are the giant marshspiders whose natural ability to camouflage themselves against the mud and the rushes and lethal venom makes them an uncommon, but potentially fatal, threat to the unwise. </p>Marcher characters from the fen are encouraged to come up with local folk tales of dangerous monsters from the deep fens, with an eye toward eerie, misunderstood threats appropriate to folklore rather than more traditional tabletop roleplaying monsters.</div></div>"

The majority of the defenders were killed refusing to leave their posts. Pilgrims visit the ruins of Overton to lay tokens at the graves of the fallen. North of the ruins, the Jotun raised a massive grass-covered burial mound, beneath which lie both the bodies of countless Imperial soldiers and the Jotun who fell fighting them. Apple trees grow at the crest - it is not clear whether the orcs planted them in deference to Marcher burial customs, or whether they are the work of the surviving monks of Greensward Abbey. When the Empire liberated Greensward shortly before the Autumn Equinox 381YE there was some talk of disinterring the mound, but the Marcher soldiers were adamant they be left to rest undisturbed - the soil may have been soured, but it is still the soil they died fighting for, whether they were Marchers or not.</p><p>Not far from the ruins stands <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Friar_of_Honour%27s_Rest#Honour.27s_Rest\" title=\"Friar of Honour's Rest\">Honour's Rest</a>, a small shrine and orchard tended by friars who watch over the ruins and the barrow mounds.<span id=\"Orchard.27s_Watch\"></span></p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ruins_of_Orchard.27s_Watch\">Ruins of Orchard's Watch</span></h3><p><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Commission\" title=\"Commission\">Commissioned</a> by the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Imperial_Senate\" title=\"Imperial Senate\">Imperial Senate</a> in Autumn 378YE, the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortify_Overton\" title=\"Fortify Overton\">fortification of Overton</a> largely took place during the Jotun ceasefire.

The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Fortification\" title=\"Fortification\">fortification</a> consisted of solid walls around most of the town, with a central keep. A number of buildings damaged by Jotun raids were  cleared, and apple trees planted in their place - a memorial to those Marchers who had died fighting for the Empire. The keep incorporated the old fortified manor house that served as a stop-gap defence - a base of operation for scouts gathering information about Jotun activity in the territory.</p><p>During the great Jotun offensive after the Winter Solstice 380YE, following several seasons of concerted attacks, the castle was levelled by orc siege engines.

The inhabitants resisted the Jotun for thirty years -  after an initial short-lived occupation by the Jotun they took back their village and the territory around it, dug in, and waited for help to come. Specifically, their survival hinged on an agreement with the local Jotun to let everything go to a fight-to-the-death between forces yearly rather than just be crushed. The Jotun agreed to this arrangement thinking they'd surely not hold on for more than a season or two. Instead, they held out for thirty years. In time, facing the Whittle folk in battle became a rite of passage for young Jotun in the Mournwold.</p><p>Unable to contact the outside world, lacking magical or mundane means to get word out that they were alive, they waited.
