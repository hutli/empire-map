Direct and efficient, few know better than they how to use the lands of the Empire to survive - and to fight. Practical, adaptable and focused, they do what they need to do to succeed. Fierce in appearance and dress, they have made themselves the allies of everyone who stands with civilisation and the savage and relentless foes of any who oppose it.</p><p>The Navarr are the blood that runs through the Empire\u2019s veins. Spirited, they throw themselves wholeheartedly into the job of serving the Empire. They carry news, messages and even people with them as they travel. For those who dwell in inhospitable places, the Navarr may be the only Imperial contact they have. Vigilant, they roam through the wild places of the Empire and keep a constant watch for the dangers that lurk there. They serve as the Empire's scouts - their work keeps the roads open and their warnings ensure the armies are ready to face the threat.</p><div class=\"captioned-image captioned-image-right\"><a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Binding.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Binding.jpg\" src=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/thumb/6/6c/Binding.jpg/500px-Binding.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"/mediawiki-public/images/6/6c/Binding.jpg 1.5x, /mediawiki-public/images/6/6c/Binding.jpg 2x\" /></a><div class=\"caption\"></div></div><p>The Navarr display their fierce heritage in battle. Warriors explode from ambush, slaughtering enemies with barbed spears. Navarr warlocks fuel magic with the primal power of blood. But in peace they are a generous people, noted for their festivities and celebrations to which all are welcome. Throughout the Empire travellers may stumble across Navarr settlements, the steadings, which offer welcome shelter and respite.</p><p>More than anyone else the Navarr know how fragile civilisation can be. Centuries ago their forebears dwelled in cities, but they were lost to war with the orcs and magic run amok. They carry the memory of that loss with them everywhere they travel, and though they still seek to reclaim the lands they lost, what drives them more is the need to ensure that it does not happen again. The Navarr know what happens to an Empire that believes itself invincible. They have lost one Empire - they are determined they will not lose another.</p><div class=\"ic\"><div class=\"ic-inner quote\"><p>\u201cNavarri fight as Thorn.\u201d</p></div></div>"

It is a realm of wonders; of majestic spires and citadels that reach toward the azure sky; of glittering lightstones that send messages arrowing across the mountain valleys in the blink of an eye; and of artificial labourers powered by magic that toil tirelessly in the fields to support the magicians and scholars of this mighty nation.</p><p>The mountains of Urizen rest on three pillars, magic, reason, and ambition.</p><p>The first pillar is magic \u2013 they see magical prowess as the highest achievement, and there are few places in the world where magicians are as influential as they are in Urizen. Magical prowess is not an end in itself, but rather a means to an end, a way to change the world. It is a tool forged through study, honed by reason, and wielded with absolute certainty. The Urizen see themselves as the only people in the world wise enough to understand the consequences of using magical power to achieve their goals. </p><p>The second pillar is reason \u2013 only those who understand the world are fit to change it. The Urizen devote themselves to study and learning, striving to perfect their understanding of the world and their place in it. Nowhere else in the world is education seen as a necessity the way it is in Urizen, a consequence of the natural drive to perfect the self. The superior understanding of the Urizen has allowed them to intervene at key moments in the past to move the Empire onto a better path. The risk is that without the light of knowledge the great experiment can only end in darkness and failure.</p><p>The third pillar is ambition \u2013 the Urizen are utopian, wanting nothing less than the perfection of all humanity. They seek to achieve excellence in the things they do, the better to perfect the world around them. There is nothing that cannot be made better by someone with the vision and will to do so. These lofty aspirations drive them to carve mountains into cities, to educate the ignorant, and to shape the fate of nations.</p><p>In Urizen the most important lesson is this \u2013 that a single individual can change the world if they have sufficient will to do so.</p>"

They revere the highest ideals, to epitomize <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Way\" title=\"The Way\">Imperial Virtues</a>, to reflect the noble obligations of leadership and thereby to embody the very spirit of the Empire. They created <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Synod\" title=\"The Synod\" class=\"mw-redirect\">the Synod</a> so that they might stand vigil over the collective soul of the Empire. Their manifest destiny is to drive the barbarians from the land and unite all humankind; they will accept nothing less.</p><p>The children of Highguard are a blazing beacon of righteousness in a dark and grimy world that too often chooses to take the easy way, to reach a compromise with vice. They stand against the tide of wickedness and say \"No. This is not acceptable. We can be better.\" Regiments of disciplined soldiers march to battle, shoulder to shoulder, determined to take the fight to the enemies of civilisation. Their first thoughts and their last are for their beloved Empire, and they know that even if they are struck down a life of virtue will see them reborn once more, given another chance to bring humankind to its shining destiny.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Chapters\" title=\"Chapters\" class=\"mw-redirect\">chapters</a>, the great stone settlements in which most Highborn dwell, are scattered across the plains that lie between Urizen and the Bay of Catazar. Many are built on ancient battle sites, scenes of triumph in the historic wars that wrested control of the land from the barbarians. All are heavily fortified, with granite quarried from the southern mountains, for the Highborn will brook no expense to protect what is theirs. \u201cWood burns, stone endures\u201d is an old Highborn aphorism that says much about their perspective.</p><p>Although the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/First_Empress\" title=\"First Empress\">First Empress</a> put aside her nationality when she united the Empire, the Highborn consider their nation the proud parent of the Empire, and themselves to be its founders, tutors and guardians. They protect the Empire with their armies, guide its hand in <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/The_Senate\" title=\"The Senate\" class=\"mw-redirect\">the Senate</a> and guard its soul in the Synod; perhaps most important of all, they keep the Imperial Histories to record and tell of the deeds that make the Empire great.</p><div class=\"ic\"><div class=\"ic-inner quote\"><p>\u201cThis is Highguard, the birthplace of the Empire. Our people, the Highborn, are the Empire\u2019s proud parents, devoted lovers, stalwart protectors and wise guides. We are the people of virtue, who enumerated the Virtues, and unlocked the Labyrinth of Ages. We are destined to be the conquerors of death, slayers of gods and false prophets, and the greatest hope of all humanity.\u201d</p></div></div>"

Competition is fierce - you might fall behind not because you have stumbled but simply because someone else is faster. Nobody is given a free ride in The League; they earn their fine lifestyles through hard work and hard dealing. You must seize every opportunity quickly if you wish to rise to become a Merchant Prince.</p><p>This is The League. The rivers that run down to the Bay of Catazar are the veins of the Empire, carrying the lifeblood of trade. The four great cities are its beating heart, sending tides of wealth back and forth across the nations. In the South are Sarvos - elegant and sophisticated, cultured and refined - and Tassato - diplomatic, Machiavellian, persuasive and articulate. In the North are Temeschwar - ruthless, relentless, cold and hard - and Holberg - pragmatic, ingenious, innovative and enlightened. Together as The League they are stronger than their parts - four strands inexorably woven to produce an unbreakable bond. They are a driven people, tolerating neither sloth nor lawlessness, and from the wealthiest moneylender to the loudest street bravo, they are quick-witted and alert to opportunity and danger.</p><p>It is said that the cities of The League never sleep. By day, the powerful guilds clash over business interests and The League's mercenary Free Companies seek to find work on the Empire's borders. By night, the street balladeers perform on every corner, and rival theatre-houses fight duels where the wordplay matters more than the swordplay. The long con is as much an art form here as the politics of high office; in the coffee-houses that never close, the cant covers both.</p><p>The League is much more than ruthless business and cut-throat competition; it is the centre of civilisation in the Empire. It produces and displays great works of art while rich patrons support the theatres. There is a university in each of the four cities and they champion scholastic learning and imaginative problem solving. They institutionalize charity - the Church of the Little Mother feeds and shelters the orphans of the Empire and finds them work - because they know that everyone is a citizen of the Empire, and that today's destitute orphans might rise to become the Merchant Princes of tomorrow.</p>"

Orcs are creatures of two worlds, guided by the whisper of those who have gone before in their souls, driven by a lust for battle that burns in their blood. While the barbarian orcs embrace these urges, the Imperial Orcs strive to temper their primal instincts with military discipline. So many choose the life of the professional soldier serving in the Imperial armies that Imperial Orc culture has a profoundly martial nature.</p><p>Yet two generations ago the Imperial Orcs were slaves. First they won their freedom by strength and indomitable will, forcing the Empire to recognise the injustice it perpetrated against them. Reluctantly the Empire gave them freedom - but nothing more. They were recognized as the tenth nation of the Empire, but they had no land to call their own. In the decades that followed they spent blood and tears fighting the Empire wars, always pursuing the promise of a home where they might put down roots. This long march to war ended recently when they were granted the territory of <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">Skarsind</a>. Now the Orcs have face an entirely new challenge - to build a nation worthy of their ancestors, worthy of their descendants.</p><p>Like battle and the voices of the ancestors, loyalty is part of the orc soul. The barbarian orcs feel a powerful instinctive loyalty towards their nation; they need to feel as if they are part of something larger than themselves. When they lacked a land of their own, the Imperial Orcs strove to make the Empire their nation. Now they have <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Skarsind\" title=\"Skarsind\">their own land</a>, some are openly questioning what must come next. Should they strive to make Skarsind the greatest territory in the Empire or seek out new territories to conquer? Their efforts have won them recognition and a place in the great councils of the Empire, but they remain the smallest nation. They will need more before they can stand among the other nations of the Empire as equals.</p><p>Orcs know they have only one life to live; they strive to burn brightly and leave a better world for their children to inherit.</p>"
